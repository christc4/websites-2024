Before discovering [Xah Lee](http://xahlee.org), I would gulp rat-poison everytime I booted my pc. I never used it for 1-2 years. Upon seeing his desktop, I went into cardiac arrest. Now I am more enlightened and can teach you all about our friend the <s>rat</s> mouse.

## Mouse

### Mice are friends but even they have boundaries

- Imagine the mouse is red-hot, don't touch/hold it for more than 5 seconds
- Finger-tip grip only, not palm grip

### Choose your friends wisely

<s>The only good mouse is a dead mouse.</s> 

Good friends have:

- >= 5 buttons
- Ergonomic shape

Really good friends have:

- Onboard memory
    - This allows mice to remember different profiles
- > 5 buttons
- Native Linux/BSD software available
    - In the case of some mice companies, remapping/profile software doesn't exist for Linux/BSD, so you have to first run said software on Windows/MacOS, then plug the mouse into Linux/BSD. 

### Mouse is a &apos;pointing&apos; device

I don't like clicking, clicking exerts energy and is an additional action one must perform to open links/files. Pointing is faster than typing - sometimes.

Mouse should only touch window edge, no reason to venture further
make video on why tiling window manager is uselss, but start by showing sowm
also demonstrate the speed of opening fcitx-confgitool with autohover

Physically show Arif, how I need to (the dumb , n lazy way, hold three things, trackpoint, mod and left click)
I don't play games so it work well
- Hoverclick
    - Why graphical menu is good e.g. "single click, double click, drag, secondary click"
    - If horizontal, and with icons
    - Sowm
    - Only move mouse when need be. Everytime the mouse moves, a click will be activated. 
    - Demonstrate in tmux and browser
    - Potential problems
    - Difficult to select items in web menu
    - Copy and paste may be problematic

Solution is to drag, and wait for the click to happen while still holding the mouse button. After the click happened, release button, but don't move the mouse.

For text selection, right-click immediately after selection, then move mouse pointer to the “copy” context menu. Even better is to roll the scroll wheel immediately after selection, as scroll also disables the click activation.:
- Backing up directories with git

### Closing words

Dear Mice, I hope you can forgive me for all the slander I've done against you
