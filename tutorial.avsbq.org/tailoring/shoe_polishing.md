# How to polish shoes

### Important

I get it, no one likes a life story before a tutorial, skip this you may.

While serving in a youth cadet force, Ihad the shiniest shoes in the platoon, no one could hold a candle to me, I ended up polishing senior cadets shoes for money, especially before major events, so my opinion has some authority,

There are a lot of opinions on shoe polishing, hundreds out there, but I am old- 19, and do not care for them.

# Equipment

*Polish*: 
- Cheap shoes, Kiwi
- Expensive shoes, Saphir

Cloth, pure cotton t-shirt,
Or jeweller sylvet

Do not use that stupid yellow rag with red stitching,
