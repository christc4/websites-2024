## Mouse

### Mice are friends but even they have boundaries

- Imagine the mouse is red-hot, don't touch/hold it for more than 5 seconds
- Finger-tip grip only, not palm grip

### Choose your friends wisely

<s>The only good mouse is a dead mouse.</s> 

Good mice have:

- >= 5 buttons

Really good mice have:

- Onboard memory
- > 5 buttons
- Native Linux/BSD
    - In the case of some mice companies, remapping/profile software doesn't exist for Linux/BSD, so you have to first run said software on Windows/MacOS, then plug the mouse into Linux/BSD.


### Mouse is a &apos;pointing&apos; device

Mouse should only touch window edge, no reason to venture further

Make video on pointing device never click again
Remember mouse is a pointing device
Physically show Arif, how I need to (the dumb , n lazy way, hold three things, trackpoint, mod and left click)

- Hoverclick
    - Why graphical menu is good e.g. "single click, double click, drag, secondary click"
    - If horizontal, and with icons
    - Sowm
    - Only move mouse when need be. Everytime the mouse moves, a click will be activated. 
    - Demonstrate in tmux and browser
    - Potential problems
    - Difficult to select items in web menu
    - Copy and paste may be problematic

Solution is to drag, and wait for the click to happen while still holding the mouse button. After the click happened, release button, but don't move the mouse.

For text selection, right-click immediately after selection, then move mouse pointer to the “copy” context menu. Even better is to roll the scroll wheel immediately after selection, as scroll also disables the click activation.:
