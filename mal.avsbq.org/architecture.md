# Architecture

### Art, Architecture, Design, it's all the same 

Let us take two people.

Person 1's route to work consists of lush gardens. The office brickwork represents the century's cultural thought. Windows, purposefully, designed for maximum light. Even the gargoyles look pretty.

Person 2's route to work is through a sovietesque concrete jungle, there are no gardens, save for the weeds and lichens growing in pavement cracks. The only gargoyles are the gorilla-faced security guards that grunt at him as he shimmys through the revolving doors. He is greeted by a massive canvas of abstraction, by some up and coming artist, who he can't make heads or tails of what it represents and the brickwork is old and industrial.
