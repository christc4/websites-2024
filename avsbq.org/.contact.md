# Rules!

You are more than welcome to get in touch with me; regarding anything related to (or not) this site.

If we've never spoken before, please don't send overly terse or &ldquo;cryptic&rdquo; emails. 

# Other

If you spot a deadlink, be it mine or to another site, I highly appreciate all reports.

I'm not on social media, there are some people operating under the same &ldquo;avsbq&rdquo; moniker as myself but I have no relationship with them. I do have an account on X displaying my iconography work but I seldom open it - so any DMs will probably be unseen to.
