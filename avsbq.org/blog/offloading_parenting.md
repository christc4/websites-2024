# Offloading parenting 

## What is offloading?

Offloading, in the context of parenting, is shulking your fatherly/motherly duties onto someone else. The closest equivalent to this word, in day-to-day exchange I guess is &apos;outsourcing&apos;

> _where you move internal operations to a third party_

At its most basic, think of offloading as passing on the parental torch - be it
basic father/son, mother/daughter interactions, heart-to-heart talks to things like the &apos;birds and the bees&apos;.

## Some scenarios

Let's brainstorm common scenarios, a semi-detailed rationale is provided for most of this, figuring out why this is is left as an excercise for the reader.</p>

### Scenario 1

A dad never establishes a fitness regimen with his growing son. His young impressionable son sees all his role-models are in great athletic shape and the most popular students at school are also athletic. Flashforward to the future, they become neraptured by a male influencer peddling self-help stories and their working out originates from their influence.

It doesn't matter if you label them a:
    - grifter
    - con-artist
    - snake-oil salesman.

Because of you're standing as a fitness instructor, your points no matter how true they may ring, are null and void in their eyes.

Acutally, this is a GradeA example of offloading, a lot of parents criminally downlpay fitness, expecting their children to just pick it up. Here's a funny story I overheard

Could their school's fitness ethos rub of on them? Sure.

### A personal scenario

## What isn't offloading?

You'd be right to point out, not everyone is a physicist, would I be offloading my parental duties by hiring a Physics tutor to teach my child? This pressumes many false things about...

I have to be a bit careful what I say now&hellip; I see this a lot in cultures that have a high emphasis on going to university and disregard self-employment or careers in trades/arts. Whereas in rural tight-knit community, traditions, techniques are passed orally.
