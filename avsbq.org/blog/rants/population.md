# Population

> _I was a college student when I read Mr. Ehrlich's &ldquo;The Population Bomb&rdquo;, I took it to heart and now have no grandchildren,  but 50 years later the population has increased to eight billion without dire consequences. I was gullible and stupid._ &ndash; Kenneth Emde, _Woodbury, Minn_
