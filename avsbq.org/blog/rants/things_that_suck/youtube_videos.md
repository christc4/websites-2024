# YouTube videos suck

I don't care about editing, it makes your video size too large, I just want some raw, unedited, organic, natural, down-to-earth, man-to-man, human-to-human, dialogue.

Unless, you're literally filming a movie - there is no reason to have one hundred cuts and CGI effects. 

No stupid intros, no stupid outros.

No fursonas, or virtual avatars.

I do want good audio though.
