# Tiling window managers *suck*

Whenever, I went around spreading the good-news of TWM's (tiling window manager)I had a set list of buzz-words. 

- Screen real-estate
- Optimal
- Lightweight/minimal

### Are tiling window managers really lightweight?

Well yes, compared to any desktop environment, TWM's come out on top. But not compared to floating window managers.

Tiling is about reducing mind over matter &ndash; or so they say.


# But tiling is less bloated!

Let's compare SOWM's lean 200 SLOC to DWM's

## Luke Smith

Luke Smith has a honourable mention here. He admitted in a livestream that he only really uses one of his many layouts patched into DWM.

# My journey

I suppose I've had enough skin in the game to have a say. Previously, I used exclusively tiling window manager for 4 years, e.g. i3, bspwm, awesome, dwm

I now use sowm 
Never in a million years would my past-self have thought of writing this. My philosophy is that programs shouldn't need to be configured.

## So&hellip;

Stop using them, if you want something better, use `tabbed` by suckless or a terminal multiplexer like tmux or dvtm. Use sowm or rio, or even better watch Xah Lee's rants on them.
