# Tiling window managers *suck*

Whenever, I went around spreading the good-news of TWM's (tiling window manager)I had a set list of buzz-words. 

- Screen real-estate
- Optimal
- Lightweight/minimal

### Are tiling window managers really lightweight?

Well yes, compared to any desktop environment, TWM's come out on top. But not compared to floating window managers.
