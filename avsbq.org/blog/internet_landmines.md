<h1>Internet landmines&hellip; or treasure chests?</h1>
<p>Our modern-web is undoubtedly overrun with landmines. Pornography, propaganda and all things evil have spread their wings over every inch of the web. With the occasional treasure chest tucked somewhere obscure&hellip; Your average user shouldn't need to hack through all that with his machete just to reach the gold.</p>

<p>When computers weren't powerful enough to display video, ads or trackers&hellip; the web was primarily limited to text. Users would click to their hearts contents, whereupon they'd be greeted with beautifully-ugly blobs of HTML. Of course, as time went by websites could acomplish a multitude of new things and so with that came the advent of internet pornography&hellip;</p>

<h2>So where are these treasure chests?</h2>
<p>I won't withold the meat of this article any longer. Here's your <a href="https://wiby.me">treasure map</a>. Wiby.me is my go-to for information on obscure topics. Want to do some internet archaelogy and dig up some 90's webpages? Look no more! Modern pages are also indexed so long as they're minimal and without javascript. By default, you won't find a trace of pornography there.</p>

<p>I shouldn't need to say this but for any parent out there, wiby.me will index pages contrary to traditional Christian values. Surprisingly enough, there's a huge bank of Mormon stuff on there&hellip; So don't let your kids be willy-nilly with what they're searching! Read on for practical solutions to this problem.</p>

In essence, there's nothing wrong with this. Urls are a chainlink - saving you from typing the whole ip, like this site's ip ;) <small>95.179.238.202</small>. That's not all they do though, YouTube and almost all the social medias routinely peddle garbage to its users, fronting as legitimate news outlets. I certainly don't want children exposed to this. Luckily for us, people have come up with a solution! Shell-scripting. You can sideline past all of this, while still allowing your children to view the end-content, with shell-scripting.</p>

<h2>But what can <em>everyone</em> do?</h2>
<p><em>That's all fine and dandy</em> you say <em>but I'm no power user</em>! For starters, that't not going to fly here. While yes, this is mainly an informational article, I want you to takeaway viable alternatives to this - not just fill your brain with stagnant trivia. The goal is to educate yourself, you don't need to know the in's and outs of shell-scripting. But if you're going to enter this bout with Satan, handicapped, you'll</p>
