# Title subject to change

I am being received into the Orthodox Church this Saturday, via baptism.

On my journey, one thing has struck me as &ndash; well not strange but curious &ndash;.

He was on the ball. Always right on the money. His sentences even in passing were like a bullet when you first heard them. 

But here's the thing, no one is reinventing the wheel. 

Don't get me wrong, I owe so much to the Protestant youth ministers who welcomed me in their home, sat down with me &ndash; real family men. They have never said anything off the cuff or even prepared that struck me.

Of course for Christians worldwide the Bible is and will continue to be the bedrock of wisdom.
