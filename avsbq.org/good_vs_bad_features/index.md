# Good vs Bad Features

I want programs, and I guess you could extapolate this to things not software, that do very little. I don't want features that are baked in the code and can't be used with other programs.

I have some examples everyone should be familiar with.

# Tabs

Tabs are very useful but I would like tabbing in all my programs not just my broowser.
