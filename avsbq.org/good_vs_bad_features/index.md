# Good vs Bad Features

## Context

In computing there's something called the &apos;[unix philosophy](https://archive.avsbq.org/compturer_science/practices/unix_philosophy)&apos;. To cut it short, programs should do *one* thing and do it *well*. Instead of a mega-monolith swiss army knife program, there are many little programs working together.

This notion, applies mainly to software and I haven't really thought about how I can extrapolate said philosophy to more tangible things. Although in theory, the software examples I provide should have equivalents in the real world.

# Tabs

Tabs are very useful but I would like tabbing in all my programs not just my broowser.
