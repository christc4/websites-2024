## Musts

- Free BIOS
    - If not _libreboot_ - then - coreboot
- Repairable
    - Parts must be both accessible and affordable

## Ideally

- Entirely modular
    - Think of &ldquo;Plug and Play&rdquo; or Lego
    - That goes for: ports, storage, cards etc
- Docking station
- Trackpoint

## Even more ideally

- Limited use of plastic.
    - Metal chassis, metal keycaps.
- IPS screen
- Programmable keyboard
- No track/touchpad
    - Just no.
- Blank keycaps
    - Prevents peck typists

## Companies that almost make the mark

Keep tabs on what these guys are doing (except for Lenovo).

- [MNT](https://mntre.com/index.html)
- [Framework](https://frame.work/gb/en)
- ThinkPad
    - All IBM ThinkPads and Lenovo ThinkPads pre x240

## People that matter

I haven't kept up with everything Louis Rossmann but like Stallman, he always gets proven right.
