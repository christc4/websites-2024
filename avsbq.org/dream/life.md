# How I do &apos;&ldquo;life&rdquo;&apos;

Here's the full quote in English from the Jane English translation:

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 80



"A small country has fewer people.

Though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster than man, they are not needed.

The people take death seriously and do not travel far.

Though they have boats and carriages, no on uses them.

Though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them.

Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing.

Their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple, their homes secure;

They are happy in their ways.

Though they live within sight of their neighbors,

And crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way,

Yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die."

 @Charlie_Yu  a great translation generally, but I think it downplays the last line, which says something like 'even though a neighboring country is in sight, and they can hear each-other's dogs and chickens, until they grow old and die, they do not come or go toward each-other', or 'they grow old and die without visiting each-other' which I ought to be interpreted as different from just leaving 'each-other in peace'


If you know who Varg Vikernes, Luke Smith you'll understand the philosophy behind this.

If you know Acorn Land labs you'll how easy it is to implement all this.

A detailed rationale will not be provided here, so there is an excercise for you the reader.

I haven't freed myself from all these &ndash; yet, when I'm older and wiser, I'll report back in detail but think about these things.

- Don't live in the city
    - Do live in the countryside
- Don't go to university, high-school or any public school
    - Do homeschool your kids
- Don't get a job
    - Do be self sufficient
    - If you must have a job, don't be in an income-bracket that pays &apos;taxes&apos; and treat it as a &apos;temporary&apos; gig.
- Don't buy products that aren't easily repairable
- Don't have &ldquo;wimpy&rdquo; or &ldquo;man-child&rdquo; friends
    - Do have a close-knit &ast;reliable friend-circle
- Do be self-sufficient
- Do be your own boss
    - Learn a trade

Of course, if you're a Christian we have an additional thing.


Lao Tzu.  Here is the quote: 《老子》第八○章：「鄰國相望，雞犬之聲相聞，民至老死不相往來。」
