# How I do &apos;&ldquo;life&rdquo;&apos;

If you know who Varg Vikernes, Luke Smith you'll understand the philosophy behind this.

If you know Acorn Land labs you'll how easy it is to implement all this.

A detailed rationale will not be provided here, so there is an excercise for you the reader.

I haven't freed myself from all these &ndash; yet, when I'm older and wiser, I'll report back in detail but think about these things.

- Don't live in the city
    - Do live in the countryside
- Don't go to university, high-school or any public school
    - Do homeschool your kids
- Don't get a job
    - Do be self sufficient
    - If you must have a job, don't be in an income-bracket that pays &apos;taxes&apos; and treat it as a &apos;temporary&apos; gig.
- Don't buy products that aren't easily repairable
- Don't have &ldquo;wimpy&rdquo; or &ldquo;man-child&rdquo; friends
    - Do have a close-knit &ast;reliable friend-circle
- Do be self-sufficient
- Do be your own boss
    - Learn a trade

Of course, if you're a Christian we have an additional thing.


Lao Tzu.  Here is the quote: 《老子》第八○章：「鄰國相望，雞犬之聲相聞，民至老死不相往來。」
