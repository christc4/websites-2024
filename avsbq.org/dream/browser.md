### &apos;Features&apos; I want in a browser.

Number 1:

- No-features

That's right, I don't want bookmarks, tabs, history, no address bar, no password management.
I want it all managed externally.
Even keybindings.
All I want my browser to do is view HTML/CSS pages and work with Javascript.
This is a given but also no "user reports" for bugs/crashes etc, I want to be able to individually submit an issue on the git page.
Sort of like how you can patch the suckless terminal to support scrollback, I'd like that in my browser but without the patch. I don't want anything baked in the code.

### Technical aspects&hellip;

Gtk or Qt?
I'd like it written in golang.

### Browsers that almost made the mark

- Surf
- Librewolf
- Nyxt
- Qutebrowser
- Badwolf
