### &apos;Features&apos; I want in a browser.

Number 1:

- No-features

That's right, I don't want bookmarks, tabs, history. 
I want it all managed externally.
This is a given but also no "user reports" for bugs/crashes etc, I want to be able to individually submit an issue on the git page.


### Browsers that almost made the mark

- Surf
- Librewolf
- Nyxt
- Qutebrowser
- Badwolf

Firefox default fireengine is google, link Luke smith issue
