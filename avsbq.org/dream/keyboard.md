### Materials

Ideally, made fully from titanium or another metal/alloy, save for the keycaps because I'm concsious on pressure on the fingers.

### Noise

Ideally quiet, switches lubed and foam padding inside to stop noise.


### Ethical

If mass-produced, or even on a scale larger than 1, there should be a clear supply chain. Nothing produced in a sweat-shop
