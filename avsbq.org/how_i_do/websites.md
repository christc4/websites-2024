# Currently

This server lives on an vult server, running openbsd. 

# Previously

Most recently, I was using SSI, .shmtl, although this was sup-optimal.
I've mainted several github.io sites in the past, in principle - those are good for understanding the basics of websites but no serious person should keep a website on them - except for standalone software sites.

# Ideally&hellip;

Down the line I'll buy a coreboot/librebooted NAS, so I can run instances/front-ends of various sites, like how [tux.pizza](https://tux.pizza/services/) does things.

What I would like are my own instances of

- Peertube
- Whoogle
- Invidious
- Git

# General advise

- Don't use LinkedIn
- Don't use Medium
- Don't use SubStack
- Don't use SquareSpace

I no longer use this but [landchad.net](https://landchad.net) has everything you need to know about aquiring a domain and setting up your first website (alongside various other self-hosting services)
