# How I do &apos;&ldquo;life&rdquo;&apos;

If you know who Varg Vikernes, Luke Smith or Acorn Land labs is you'll understand this more.

I haven't freed myself from all these &ndash; yet, when I'm older and wiser, I'll report back in detail but think about these things.

- Don't live in the city
- Don't go to university, sixth-form, secondary, primary or any public school
- Don't get a job
    - If you do, don't be in an income-bracket that pays &apos;taxes&apos;

- Do be self-sufficient
- Do be your own boss
    - Learn a trade
- Do have a close-knit &ast;reliable friend-circle

Of course, if you're a Christian we have an additional thing.
