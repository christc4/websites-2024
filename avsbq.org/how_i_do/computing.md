# _Everything you'd want to know about my computing_

Ordered by usage

## Hardware

- *LAPTOP*: Thinkpad x230 & x61s
    - My x230 has Coreboot and the Classic keyboard mod. I've written more about it here [blank](http://avsbq.org) and I plan on several future upgrades.
    - The x6 series is my sweetheart, I love the compact keyboard and 4:3 screen, however my particular x61s has a compromised bios.

## Software

- *BROWSER*: librewolf, surf, nyxt
    - librewolf, has sane privacy defaults, surf, simply beautiful, nyxt - I need to learn
- *DOCUMENT VIEWER*: zathura
- *EDITOR*: acme, sam, ed
    - If I'm dealing with multiple files/directories I prefer acme, if it's a reasonable amount sam. If I've ssh'd into a server I'll usually run sam -d or plain old ed or vim.
- *FILE MANAGER*: lf, clifm
- *OS*: artix, openbsd
- *TERMINAL*: st
- *TYPESETTING*: groff, postscript, latex

## Peripherals

- *MONITOR*: anything 4:3
- *KEYBOARD*: generic membrane
    - I've used mechanical ones before but obsessing over them is a superfluous interest
- *MOUSE*: contour classic (wired) (large) (left handed)
    - three-button, the way a mouse should be

### Hardware I want 

#### Keyboards:

- tex shinobi
- kinesis
- unicomp endura pro
- Framework
    - Only if it has a trackpoint and work has been made towards coreboot support

## Miscellaneous

I like standing desks,
run this command for blue light,

I speak about this in hushed tones, this is my old &apos;gaming&apos; pc (insert soyjack now). Don't buy a gaming pc. Don't play games that can't run on old computers. Don't game in general. Massive time vampire.
