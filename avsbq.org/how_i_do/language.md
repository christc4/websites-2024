# English

Anytime, I hear an interesting word/phrase/quote, I write it down. 

When, I was studying GCSE English-Literature, our teacher got us to record extensible phrases, words - so as to boost our writing. This should be extended to daily speech.

I consciously try to include as many compound words in written and spoken English.

I like using archaic words
