# English

Anytime, I hear an interesting word/phrase/quote, I record it &ndash; don't just make a &apos;mental note&apos; of it.

When, I was studying GCSE English-Literature, our teacher drilled into our heads the concept of &apos;reading&apos; to mine good-sounding phrases and words - so as to boost the level of our writing. In principle this is good but &ndash; left as is &ndash; is completely idiotic. A good English teacher would immediately recognise the need to extend this to all factors of communication to: daily, written, informal and formal speech.

Unless, I am engaging in a topic where the use of Latin/latinised vocabulary is essential to relay concepts - I always try to speak using Germanic vocabulary. There are many reasons why all English speakers should make a conscious effort to do this. Archaic and compound words are easier for our brains but I've written about this, [here]().

# Chinese

I'm not fluent at all in Mandarin, maybe I share a speaking-level akin to a toddler. I like to listen to native speakers, intuations and accents to get a feel for how to say words naturally.

# Bengali

Bengali (Bangla) is a very sweet language but many people butcher and abuse it.
In fact, the only experience most Westeners have is with the Syhleti language, which sounds like a shouting match between two angry folk, and miscategorise it as being Bangla itself.
