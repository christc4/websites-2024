### General advice

- Don't use LinkedIn
- Don't use Medium
- Don't use SubStack

Those are the ones that come to my head, never &apos;sign-up&apos; for a &apos;platform&apos;, always have your own.

I'd start listing all the people that have been witchhunted of said platforms and alike but that's an exercise for you to go of and figure out &ndash; who &ndash; and why?

In any case, getting a website has never been cheaper and more accessible for normal folk. Of course, me even saying that warrants me to tell you how to go about doing so. You can find out how I manage this site, [here](https://tutorial.avsbq.org/software/web)

- Don't use Wix
- Don't use Wordpress
- Don't use Squarespace

to make sites.

And for good measure&hellip;
