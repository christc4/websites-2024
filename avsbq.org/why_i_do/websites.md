# General advice

- Don't use LinkedIn
- Don't use Medium
- Don't use SubStack

I'd start listing all the people that have been witchhunted of said platforms and alike but that's an exercise for you to go of and figure out &ndash; who &ndash; and why?

In any case, getting a website has never been cheaper and more accessible. Of course, me even saying that warrants me to tell you how to go about doing so. You can find out how I manage this site, [here](https://tutorial.avsbq.org/software/web)
