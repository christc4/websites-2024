# Logitech G203 Prodigy Gaming Mouse

I first bought this on, in eBay for 

## Should you buy?

If you have baby hands, then yes. There are much better Logitech mice in the secondhand market with far more features. My personal opinion is, do not buy. Maybe, as a spare mouse and if you come across this under 6 pound then buy.

### What could be better?

More side buttons. Scroll wheel spin should be on par as the G502, it doesn't spin well.

### Other

This product is made overseas in China, so keep that in mind.
