# Review of Postal Services

Stop. Please recommend me a fast and reliable international shipping service from the UK.

## Race of workers

*Royal Mail*: I have seen only white British posties in East London atleast.

*DHL*: Lots and lots of Indians

*Evri* Lots of Eastern Europeans



## Evri

### Evri international

Whatever domestic courier they work with must operate at a snail's pace. Will never use again.

## Royal Mail

### Royal Mail international

Same problem as Evri international, arrived month and half late, was urget document. DO NOT USE.
