# Review of Postal Services

Stop. Please recommend me a fast and reliable international shipping service from the UK.

## Race of workers

*Royal Mail*: I have seen only white British posties in East London atleast.

*DHL*: Lots and lots of Indians

*Evri* Lots of Eastern Europeans



## Evri

2024/04/26, 22:46, for the past few weeks Evris people have been delivering incredibly late hours of the night, completely idiotic . The apartment I am currently in (2024), has a sign that says do not leave items downstair Evri either exclusively hires from the illiterate.

Talk about h ow the driveer failed to collecw microwave and when he came to drop of another item, he then finally saw on his phone the pickup scthediel



thi is  is highly dependant on how compotent and how willing the &apos;extra mile&apos; he will walk

### Evri international

Whatever domestic courier they work with must operate at a snail's pace. Will never use again.

## Royal Mail

### Royal Mail international

Same problem as Evri international, arrived month and half late, was urget document. DO NOT USE.

### Yodel

Delivered item at completely wrong building across the street
