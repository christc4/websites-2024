<h2>Guides</h2>
<p><small><strong>NOTE:</strong></small> as mentioned in the about section, this is a guiding rope to avoid common pitfalls. Whenever, I personally make an error in my tempura icons, I'll frame it in a constructive manner so we can learn from it and not repeat it again.</p>
<h2>Drawing ‚úèÔ∏è</h2>
<p>Learn to draw. This might sound like I'm preaching to the choir but reaxamine all your drawings. The foundation of an icon, the pencil tracing, can make or break an icon's beauty, therefore it is essential to have a watertight drawing technique. You don't need to know everything there is with pencil, just learn where lights and shadows go, how proprotion works etc&hellip;
</p>
<p>If you have no experience with drawing, I'd highly advise you to start now. It might feel hair-tearingly agonising or you may be a natural at it. This isn't a shortcut you can skip.
</p>
<h2>Painting üé®üñåÔ∏è</h2>
<p>Faint lines are more forgiving, prominent lines less so.</p>
<p>Try not to move the tracing paper red-thingy, otherwise you will smudge like I did,</p>
<h2>Lastly</h2>
<p>I'm not a spiritual authority, so I'll keep it brief. Painting icons is a form of prayer and the icons others receive are to help them pray. 
Yes we strive for beauty, like all other things in life, but treating this as any other secular activity isn't the way forward.</p>
