### Measuring unemployment

#### Claimant counter

Job seekers allowance, fraud could lead to an underestimation, excludes people out of work actively seeking mork but dont claim training schemes, easy and cheap to collect
The claimant court has historically underestimated unemployment

### Causes of unemployment

Impossible to reach 0 percent unemployment due to various mismatches:

- Seasonal unemployment
- Frictional unemployment
- Geographical lunemployment
- Structural unemployment
- Real wage (classsical) unemployment
- Cyclical (demand-deficient) unemplayment

#### Seasonal unemployment

A mismatch between the demand for workers and the supply of workers

- Tourism
- Construction
- Post office/delivery workers
- Farming

#### Frictional unemployment

A mismatch in information - the time involved in finding a new job

- Search cost
- Hiring/Firing policies &amp; laws

#### Geograaphical unemployment

A mismatch between the location of a worker and a job

Cost of living/moving
Information gaps
Family/soocial ties
Cultural/language barriers

#### Structural unemployment

A mismatch between the skills of workers and the skills required

- Globalisation
- Welsh mines
- Detroit car factories
- Technology
	- Assembly line workers
	- Train drivers

#### Real wage (Classical) unemployment

A mismatch in the wages workers are being paid and the wage workers are "worth"

Causes are:
- Minimum wage
- Trade unions
- Deflation

#### Cyclical unemplayment

A mismatch in the supply and demand of goods and workers

##### Hysteresis 

When a deep recossion not only damages actual growth but also potential growth

- Unemployed workers may lose skills such that overall productivity decreases in the long run
- Employed workers have greater bargaining power and can prevent real-wages from falling to their equillibrium level (sticky wages)


Hysteresis hypothesis recossions can have permanent negative impacts on the economy/labour markets

 Some GDP is lost output may be unrecoverable and the trend growth rate may be weaker

Hysteresis hypothesis recssions can have permanent negative impacts on the econmy/labour markets

Unemployment: hysteresis doesnt appear to hold when looking at unemhployment dat
