### Rainforest

*Spatially*, the Amazon is the largest rainforest *globally*, wherein an area the *size of Wales* is deforested *each year*; being repurposed for anthropogenic activities such as: cattle ranching and logging. A repurcussion of this is the natural water cycle being disturbed. Impermeable surfaces, such as the compression of soils from repeated machinery and livestock, reduce soil porosity, which in turn reduces levels of interception and causes flooding.

### Freeze thaw weathering

Freeze thaw weathering, is when rainwater seeps into cracks and joints within the geological strata, wherein it freezes at sub-tero temperature, which the ice increases by 10% in size, causing the roc to shatter, which is exacerbated by high durnal ranges.

### Climate change

Climate change is a change in *global* or *regional* climate patterns. This has been argued to have accelerated with *80ppm of Co2* be8ng released in the *last 50 years* causing the elvel of Co2 to reace over *400* ppm in the atmosphere.

If mitigation of climate change isn't taken the argued tipping point to which the effects are irreversible is by *20230* this can be seen within the cited region of the maldivers where of 200 of their 1200 islands are inhabitle due to sea level rise, the maldives could be wiped out by 2080.

### Explain role of cryospheric change in the water cycle

The cryosphere refers to the major storage of water in the form of ice approximately 1.7%. The cryosphere affects the water cycle by maintaining sea levels. For example, during interglacial warming periods, melting takes place adding water to hydrospheric stores such as... Which in turn causes an increased input of water into the ocean stroage meaning sea level rise both due to increased volume and thermal expansion.

Because ice decreases albedo effect and thermal expansion, converse of claical periods, latent heat of freezing , and talk about permathroust. 

Cryospheric change has a regulatory role in sea levels, in a period of cooling (glacias period) the cryosphere can grow in sive, as the water cycle is slowed considerably as the ice restricts the return of water to the sea and ocean, vice versa during periods of warming the cryosphere will add water to the cycle, as the water cycle restarts more of the ice melts and returs water to the sea, this increases the sive of the ocean store causing sea levels to rise throughd increased volumes of wmatetr.

### Explain the concept of dynamic equillibrium in relation to the water cycle

- Dynamic equllibrium, lacj of change in a system, inputs and outputs in xalance, if changes over eehback allows for correlation


- Closed system, where no mater leave-\ekits but energy is transyerred\ no water is added to the global budget, closed system of linked processes.

Dynamic equillibrium refers to the tendency towards a natural state of balance within the hydrological cyle, which is closed , no water is added or leazes the global water budget, water is simply recycled around the system.

The dynamic equillibrium, is easily upset by extreme weather events such as stroms or even huban activity e.g modifyinfg the dynamic equillibrium. This in turn causes disruption and inteference to the dynamic equillibrium and is evidenced through flooding, such events and processes cause sudden changes in the state of the system.

Note: the drainage basin element of the hydrological cycle is the open system where the inputs and outputs can change.

Is the carbon cycle closed?

### Answering a six marker

The graph shows that *overall* Africa is *expected* to see an *increase* in rainfall amount for most months.

This is *evidenced* by months such as, *provide examples*, which also indicates biggest increases around 4mm,

However, *contrary to the pattern*, from *MONTH* to *MONTH* the model suggests that rainfall will be lower than the *DATA* average by as much as *DATA* in *MONTH*.

THIS map gives further information about how changes identified may affect rainfall spatially across africa

### A six marker,

Prolonged periods of rainfall prior to a strom appear to have contributed to the impact of antecedent rainfall. This antecedent rainfall leads to full storage in ground water and in the soil. Saturated groundwater prior to this event has exacerbated the impact of the storm. this almost certainly speeds up overland flow
surface runoff during the storm.

Rock type and gradient lead to the hydrograph flashiness.

An increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide can in turn cause higher rates of evapotranspiration.
Through photosynthesis water influences CO2 absorption through atmospheric store to biosphere.
Water can transfer CO2 from atmosphere to lithosphere/hydrosphere through precipitation in the form of acid rain, in the oceans this thien becomes carxbonic acid.

Amazon rainforest trees intercept 75% of rainfall, ald send it backto the atmosphere, they also absorb co2 and store it. For decomosiion to ocean, water is needed by the decomposers. decompositin is essential for the transfer of carbon from previously locked iomass,it to the atmosphere, which in turn allows for nutrient cycling e.g. in the amazon which suports growth of new plants, 50% of tree bark w
