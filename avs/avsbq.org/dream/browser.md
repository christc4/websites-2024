### &apos;Features&apos; I want in a &dollar;BROWSER

Number 1:

- No-features

That's right, I don't want bookmarks, tabs, history, no address bar, no password management, pdf viewers. I want it all managed externally. Even keybindings.

Sort of how you achive tabbing in Surf with suckless' program &apos;tabbed&apos;. Or how you can patch the st terminal to support scrollback. Although I don't want to have to patch programs. I want nothing baked in the source code.

All I want my browser to do is display HTML/CSS pages and work with Javascript.

I want documents like pdfs to open with my external document viewer, stored in /tmp.

This is a given but also no "user reports" for bugs/crashes etc, I want to be able to individually submit an issue on the git page. It also has to be 100% free software, that's free as in _libre_ not free as in _gratis_.

### Technical aspects&hellip;

Number 2:

Written in a sane language.

Gtk or Qt?
I'd like it written in golang.

- Surf
