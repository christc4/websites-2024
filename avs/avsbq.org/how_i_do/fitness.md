# How I do fitness

## Calisthenics or weight-lifting

Either is good, calisthenics can be done in public-bathrooms, parks, sitting on a desk-chair etc. Weight-lifting is more challenging to do in public.

### Find a friend

Working out alone is very lonely at times.

If you're friend always comes up with an excuse to working out - or treats it like kryptonite - don't bother with them.
