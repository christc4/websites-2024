# How I broke my x61s

I broke a x61s motherboard today. Let's frame everything I did wrong in a constructive manner so you can learn from my idiocy. I'll start by recreating the crime scene.

## Crime scene

What am I looking at you ask? Well to put it short, that black wire you see crawling on the screen? That's connected to the power jack in the bottom right corner and, which I didn't bother checking at the time. I hooked it up to the speaker port in the top left corner. What was the outcome of that. My friend and I got a very nice light show (sparks on the board and some transistors got fried).

Here's a close up.

## Why I did that

Do you see that red and black cable tucked away next to the RAM? Yep, that's the speaker plug, it's been donkeys-years since I hid it there. I didn't want it bumping around and I wasn't using the speaker at the time so it seemed the most convenient place.

Here's what it's supposed to look like on another board I owned.

And that black wire? It's meant to hook up to a bluetooth card.

Funny thing is just before all this unfolded. My friend called my McGyve style SSD removal genius. Here's a tip to removing a SSD if you don't have a caddy the with pull tab, get some tape and jimmy it up there, double sided on some thin plastic works. Or if you're tape is really-really strong you can just tap it on the SSD and pull.

Well, you shouldn't throw genius around liberally, I had 2 spare x61s motherboards with me and I could have done a quick web search to see what that black cable even was.

Anyways lesson learned. I hope I've framed my blunder in a constructive manner. Don't operate on guesswork, only toddlers plug random things in.

And I'll probably only mention in hushed tones now that I used to repair ThinkPadsfor a lving during 2020-2022&hellip;

Anyways its got a compromised bios
