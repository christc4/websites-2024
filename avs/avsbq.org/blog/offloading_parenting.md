# Offloading parenting

Last updated, 2024/04/18

## What is offloading?

Offloading, in the context of parenting, is shulking your fatherly/motherly duties onto someone else. The closest equivalent to this word, in day-to-day exchange I guess is &apos;outsourcing&apos;

> _where you move internal operations to a third party_

At its core, just imagine offloading as passing on the parental torch to complete strangers.

## Some scenarios

To get your brain thinking and so you can relay and recognise this harmful behaviour in real life, let's brainstorm some scenarios. 

### Scenario 1

A dad never establishes a fitness regimen with his growing son. His young impressionable son sees all his role-models are in great athletic shape and the most popular students at school are also athletic. Flashforward to the future, they become enraptured by a male influencer peddling self-help stories and their working out originates from their influence.

It doesn't matter if you label this wellspring of motivation as a:

    - grifter
    - con-artist
    - snake-oil salesman

Because of you're non-existant standing as a person of fitness, your points no matter how true they may ring, are often disregarded as null and void in their eyes.

This is a GradeA example of offloading, parents far and large criminally downplay fitness, expecting &ndash; or simply not caring if their children pick it up.

### Anecdote time

Could their school's fitness ethos rub of on them? Sure.

### A personal scenario

## What isn't offloading?

You'd be right to point out, not everyone is a physicist, would I be offloading my parental duties by hiring a Physics tutor to teach my child? This pressumes many false things about...

I have to be a bit careful what I say now&hellip; I see this a lot in cultures that have a high emphasis on going to university and disregard self-employment or careers in trades/arts. Whereas in rural tight-knit community, traditions, techniques are passed orally.
