The global commons, are *shared resources of the earth* not owned by one particular country/government. Examples are the *earth's oceans or Antarctica*.

Access to these resources by all countries pave threats of exploitation e.g. *overfishing/whaling* in Anctarctica. Which leads to the *tragedy of the commons* where if a single country acts ouf of their own vested interests, in turn causes global failure where finate resources are depleted.

The global commons include areas that have no national governance but are used fairly by all people.

The only landmass considered to be a part of it is antarctica, some  shared but not controlled by a single country, languagegs science cyber space , which is commonly referred as the *common heritage of humanity*

Advancements in technology means resources are in danger of exploitation, take for example the presence of rich oil reserves in anctarctica, as the cost of extraction decreases with new technological extractions with deep oil renreel , the desire and demand for countries to extract oil increases.

The overarching notion of the tragedy of commons means there is no single jurisdiction there is almays potential for exploitaiton, as current resources become edpletede there will be an increasing need for the global commons to meet the needs of teh world population
As current resources become depleted there will be an increasinf neei yfor the global commons to meet the needs of the present world population
