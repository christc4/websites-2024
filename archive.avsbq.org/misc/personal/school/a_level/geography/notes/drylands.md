# Drylands, part 1

[Original source](https://dredfern.substack.com/p/drylands)

Around one third of the land on Earth can be classified as dryland (Figure 1), where there is a water-balance deficit.

### The water-balance and the aridity index

Aridity, or the lack of water, is the most important criterion in defining deserts or drylands. A simple aridity index (AI) is used by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to define just how dry a dryland is:

AI = P/PET

where P = mean annual precipitation and PET = mean annual potential evapotraration.

Using the AI the following dryland subdivisions exist (Figure 1):

- hyper arid (AI < 0.05)

- arid (0.05 < AI < 0.20)

- semi-arid (0.20 < AI < 0.50)

Hyper-arid areas cover 4% of the Earth's surface, arid about 15%, and semi-arid another 15%. Therefore combined,
one third of the Earth's land surface is arid in some form - and the home of 20% of the world's population. These areas are often referred to as &apos;deserts&apos; of which the Sahara, Namib, Kalahari, Atacama, Patagonian, Arabian, Thar, Mojave, Sonora, and Australian deserts are the best known. [Figure 1]

There are alternative ways in which deserts are classified. Some refer to warm (or hot) deserts, whereas there are also deserts where, due to either high latitude or high altitude, there are winter frosts (cold deserts). Likewise, coastal deserts such as the Atacama and Namib deserts have very different temperatures and levels of humidity from the deserts of continental interiors. Equally some deserts, such as those in Arabia and Australia, have much less relief (mountains and valleys) than others. The mountain and basin deserts of southwest USA and Iran have much steeper relief and consequently have very different landscape features. Within desert regions of these two structural types, some areas are dominated by wind action, some by the action of water. Some have extensive areas of erosion and others have extensive areas of deposition.


*Reasons for aridity*

Hot deserts occur in four locations where there is very little rain:

- latitudes dominated by dry subsiding air
- inland, far from sources of moist maritime air
- on coasts flanked by cold ocean currents or cold upwelling ocean water
- in the rain shadow of high mountain ranges

*Influence of latitude*

Figure 1 shows that many of the world's largest hot deserts occur in roughly the same latitudes. For example, the Saharan and Arabian desert extend eastwards across the deserts of Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into the Thar desert of India, and lie astride the Tropic of Cancer, roughly between latitudes 15&deg;N and35&deg;N. The southern hemisphere deserts of Australia, the Kalahari and the Atacama are along the Tropic of Capricorn (latitude 23&deg;S). To understand this, we need to consider how the global atmospheric circulation system works.

Global atmospheric circulation

Atmospheric circulation is controlled by solar radiation, which is greatest at the equator because here the sun is directly overhead for much of the year. With distance from the equator the sun’s rays travel more obliquely through the atmosphere because of the curvature of the Earth, and this means that progressively more incoming radiation is reflected or absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere with increasing latitude. Because of the tilt of the Earth’s axis, the sun is directly over each of the tropics once a year, at the summer solstice.

Hadley cells

Hot tropical deserts like the Sahara are a direct result of the atmospheric circulation cells (often termed Hadley cells) that occur between equator and the tropics [Figure 2]. In other words, the location of these deserts is determined by latitude rather than by the regional distribution of land and sea. As it is heated, the warm air in equatorial latitudes rises by convection, expands, and cools. Cold air can store less water vapour than the same volume of warm air, so the rising air becomes saturated as it cools, and the excess water vapour condenses to form clouds. These humid air masses release much of their moisture over the equatorial zone before moving further from the equator in both hemispheres. As they become cooler and denser, they eventually begin to subside. The tropical latitudes around 20-30&deg; north and south dominated by atmospheric subsidence. Hot tropical deserts like the Sahara and Arabia are in these latitudes, where the air above them is dry and subsiding, and the atmospheric pressure is high for much of the year. The surface winds in such deserts are therefore generally directed outwards, towards areas of lower atmospheric pressure, and so little moisture is brought in by surface winds. As the air over the deserts subsides it is compressed and becomes warmer, so it can absorb additional water vapour. The result is that the relative humidity of desert air is usually very low and only reaches dew point (100% relative humidity) when the night temperatures fall low enough for desert dew to precipitate on chilled rock surfaces, especially the darker ones. This ephemeral dew allows gazelles and other small creatures to survive despite the lack of surface water. The former can be seen licking this dew water from the darker rocks on the ground shortly before sunrise.
