Around one third of the land on Earth can be classified as dryland (Figure 1), where there is a water-balance deficit.

### The water-balance and the aridity index

Aridity, or the lack of water, is the most important criterion in defining deserts or drylands. A simple aridity index (AI) is used by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to define just how dry a dryland is:

AI = P/PET

where P = mean annual precipitation and PET = mean annual potential evapotraration.

Using the AI the following dryland subdivisions exist (Figure 1):

- hyper arid (AI < 0.05)

- arid (0.05 < AI < 0.20)

- semi-arid (0.20 < AI < 0.50)

Hyper-arid areas cover 4% of the Earth's surface, arid about 15%, and semi-arid another 15%. Therefore combined,
