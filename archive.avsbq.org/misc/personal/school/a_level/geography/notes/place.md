# Physical features

The site of a place is the acutal land it is built on. Settlements have historically taken root wherever geographical site factors favour economic activities that cannot be carried out as profitably elsewhere. Local resources such as coal or water explain why some places are where they are. Places within large cities have their own advantageous site factors and topography. The high elevation of London's Hampstead neighbourhood, for example, provided wealthy Victorians with clean air and safe water. It remains an affluent place.

# Economic functions

The economic function of a place is what it does in terms of providing services and work for people. Originally, this tended to be linked with site factors. Many places have changed their function over time. Liverpool and Manchester are now post-industrial cities where consumer services have replaced manufacturing industries. In some post-productive rural places, agriculture has given way to tourism. Economic functions and site factors are interconnected insofar as industry may cause physical changes (resources eventually become depleted, groundwater abstraction can lead to ground subsidence or other physical change).

# Cultural landscapes

The cultural landscape is everything we see in a place. It is the totality of the changes which people have brought to the natural landscape, including the architecture, infrastructure, heritage, and demography of a place. It also includes the art, music (soundscape) and sporting life of a place. Originally, football teams drew their amateur players from local factories (the cannon on Arsenal’s badge reflects the club’s birth in the 1880s among the munitions factories of Woolwich, by the river Thames).

As stated above, geographers studying place refer to insider and outsider perspectives.

Insider perspectives:

·         develop through everyday experiences in familiar settings – daily rhythms (e.g. the school run) and shared experiences (e.g. socialising at the village pub)

·         are based on experiences acquired over time

·         underpin the subjectivity that is the basis for the sense of place of a community

·         are intimate/personal views.

Outsider perspectives:

·         are often about looking and learning - a personal view of entering a location or landscape and discovering that place, as a visitor

·         see things afresh

·         ask questions that the inhabitants don’t think to ask because the answers are so familiar

·         are neutral/abstract views.

Categories of place

Various cultural geographers have tried to categorise places. Some categories include ‘far places’, ‘near places’, ‘experienced places’ and ‘media places’. Perhaps these are best illustrated by the following?

Consider a village near Banbury in rural ‘middle’ England where people of different social groups live. At one extreme of the community there are highly educated academics, scientists and businesspeople, mainly men, whose work is based in the nearby city of Oxford, though they all have computers with high-speed broadband at home. These are in constant contact with, and physically travelling between, colleagues and customers all around the world. The spaces that they move in, both physically and virtually, are thoroughly global (far places). At the other extreme of the scale are people who have never been to London and only rarely have made it as far as Oxford, to go to the shops or maybe to the hospital. Members of this group are known as the ‘locals’, and most of them work on farms or in village shops and services (near places).

Other people in these villages work locally but are employed as cleaners or caterers by multinational firms, for which this is just one group of workers among many scattered over the globe. Finally, there are women (mostly) who are the partners of the men, several of whom are occupied in a daily round of nurseries and child-minders, often being the heart and soul of local meetings and charities (near places). They tend to drive into Oxford to do their shopping, maintain contacts with extended family outside the local area and like to go on holiday to somewhere ‘exotic’ (far places).

This account of the different social groups in this hypothetical village shows how place is far more permeable for some (the wealthy incomers and out-goers) than it is for others. In addition, within that social grouping, there are gender differences in the shaping of activities within the place. However, even the more rooted, less travelled lower income people here are increasingly touched by wider events. Farm workers, for example, are subject to agricultural policy decisions made in London or elsewhere, and the cleaners and caterers who work for multinational firms in the area might well feel the force of global economics if those companies were to cut back on jobs (all experienced places).

Add to these the assertion that in today’s electronic society people have no ‘sense of place’; rather they occupy media places. Electronic media are undermining the traditional relationship between a physical setting and a social setting. The world’s media bring to our location events that are taking place in another location, and hence in some ways we are transported to that location even though we remain in our location. At a much smaller scale is the situation in which two people are having a telephone or a WhatsApp conversation in two different locations. Indeed, the telephone (or computer) brings them closer together than with other people in their respective locations. Furthermore, the plethora of media communications in recent years has forced us to consider the bias or agenda of the source(s).
