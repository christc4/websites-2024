[Time to do another one of these – from the Principality….]

A reminder: for A level Geography, there are two key Assessment Objectives (AOs):

AO1: demonstrate knowledge and understanding of places, environments, concepts, processes, interactions, and change, at a variety of scales.

AO2: apply knowledge and understanding in different contexts to interpret, analyse, and evaluate geographical information and issues.

So, as on previous occasions, here are two versions of the answer.

The first answer is unannotated.

The second answer is in two formats:

(a)     AO1 in italics

(b)     AO2 in bold.

Assess the severity of the challenges faced by some rural places. (15 marks)

The challenges faced by some rural places depend on the location of that area because each of accessible and remote rural areas face different challenges as the latter are less well connected, more isolated and harder to develop economically. On the other hand, accessible rural places are often under pressure from nearby urban areas.

Remote areas, such as Mid-Wales, the Western Isles and North Northumberland face a major problem with a lack of rural services ranging from the closure of post-offices to pubs being uneconomic and primary schools having too small enrolment. As populations have declined and aged, due to out-migration of the young, such services have closed or moved online. This has left older people struggling to access basic services. Conversely, younger workers and families who live in these areas often have the technology and transport to access services either online or in distant cities. However, these people face the major challenge of finding a home to buy, or rent, as second-home ownership by city dwellers increases.

The challenges may be much more severe for some groups. Among the elderly, people of low incomes and those with long-term health issues and/or mobility, deprivation may be the most severe challenge leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness as well as service deprivation.

In accessible rural areas close to cities, such as rural Kent or Sussex being near to London, pressures come from counter-urbanisation where wealthier families and retirees move out to the countryside. This increases demand for homes and increases house prices. Younger people are priced out of the housing market. However, despite rising accessible rural populations, local services may continue to close as these incomers use services in nearby urban areas. Pressure for new house building which can change the traditional character of rural settlements can also be significant. These new houses may also be built on floodplains, formerly marsh or meadow land, which are now liable to flood.

Rural areas such as Devon, Cornwall, Pembrokeshire, and Cumbria face an additional challenge of excessive reliance on summer tourism. Despite isolation, they are overcrowded in summer, with many jobs being low-paid and seasonal. Holiday homes often account for 10% or more of housing stock. There is little to keep young people in these places, so the places suffer from out-migration of young, educated, and skilled locals.

In conclusion, each of isolated, accessible and tourism hotspots face a range of overlapping challenges. Isolated places face the most severe challenges of population decline, an ageing population, shrinking services and limited mobility, with very few options for economic development. Other rural areas face development pressures from counter-urbanisation and tourism so at least have some economic opportunities even if they are not ideal. (449)
