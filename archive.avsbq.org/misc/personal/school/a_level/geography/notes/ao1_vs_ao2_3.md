# AO1 v. AO2 (3)

Following a recent online CPD on the Water/Carbon cycles I undertook for a school, I am reminded of this question, initially from an Edexcel (Pearson) context. The question could occur for any of the three main UK boards, with mark allocations varying from 6 to 12. The time allocated for this answer is about 12/15 minutes. The AO weighting is likely to be balanced.

A reminder: for A level Geography, there are two key Assessment Objectives (AOs):

AO1: demonstrate knowledge and understanding of places, environments, concepts, processes, interactions and change, at a variety of scales.

AO2: apply knowledge and understanding in different contexts to interpret, analyse, and evaluate geographical information and issues.

Knowing how to separate and use these two AOs is fundamental in answering examination questions.

As before, the answer is in two formats:

(a)    Normal font â€“ no AO indicated.

(b)   AOs indicated: AO1 in italics; AO2 in bold.

Figure 1 shows the global carbon cycle. Using Figure 1, assess the role of oceans in regulating the carbon cycle.
