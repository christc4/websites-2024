# The connections between landscape, climate change, plate tectonics and military history

Around the world November 11th marks the time when those who have served in the armed forces are honoured and remembered for their sacrifice. In the UK the day is observed as Remembrance (and/or Armistice) Day; in the United States it is called Veteranâ€™s Day. The date was originally chosen to mark the anniversary of the end of hostilities in World War I (WW1), then known as the Great War. In 1918 fighting ceased at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month with the signing of an armistice between the Allied nations and Germany.

Landscape features

Although WW1 ended more than a hundred years ago, the landscape still records, and reveals its legacy. For example, craters and trenches still scar the terrain of France and Belgium. Some of the trenches, as well as the craters from explosives, are still visible from the air. One such crater is Lochnagar Crater, near the town of Albert (Figure 1). The crater is the result of explosives packed into a long tunnel in the ground, detonated on July 1, 1916, by British forces. The explosion produced a crater that measured 100 metres wide and 21 metres deep.
