Various factors create the diversity of dryland landscapes.

Land surface

The composition of the land surface has an impact on what happens to the rain falling. For example, compare rain falling on a rock slope vs a salt-rich surface in a topographic depression (a pan, or playa). Water hitting a rock slope will flow over the surface as runoff. In contrast, rain falling in the playa will pond up, dissolve soluble salts, and mostly evaporate or infiltrate.

Energy

Inputs of energy in dryland landscapes come from:

·       the wind, which can pick up, transport and deposit sediment

·       gravity, which provides potential energy for geomorphic processes on slopes

·       insolation, or heat and light from the sun

·       directly from flora and fauna, such as burrowing rodents or termites that build intricate above-ground pinnacle structures.

Sediment

Sediment flows through these landscapes mainly via water (fluvial processes) and wind (aeolian processes). Landforms are created by erosion and deposition of sediment. Water is one of the most important elements in landscape forming, even if it only flows infrequently. The morphology of many dryland rivers is controlled by high-magnitude, low-frequency flow events (big, rare floods).

Large-scale landscapes

At the largest spatial scale dryland landscapes divide into two types:

·       low-relief plains in a tectonically stable setting (e.g. much of central Australia, the central Arabian Peninsula and southern Africa)

·       alternating mountains and enclosed basin drainage (e.g. much of the southwest USA, southern America, Iran, Afghanistan, and parts of central Asia).

Ancient landforms

The mountains and plateaux that are found in several of the world’s great deserts were not formed under an arid climate:

In the Sahara the volcanic massif of the Hoggar originated around 15 million years ago, well before the Sahara existed as a desert, and arose through volcanic activity, not climatic changes.

The mountains north of the Taklimakan Desert in western China existed many millions of years before aridity occurred and were the result of tectonic movements.

The arid Flinders Ranges in South Australia were uplifted and deeply eroded during times of much wetter regional climate than today. Uluru (formerly Ayers Rock) in arid central Australia, and the isolated granite hills known as inselbergs that are so common in the drier regions of Australia, Africa and India formed originally because of prolonged deep weathering under a dense cover of tropical rainforest. When the climate becomes less humid and the plant cover becomes less dense, erosion begins to outpace weathering, until the former deep weathering mantle is stripped off by fluvial erosion and the underlying irregular weathering front is exposed to the elements — an example of an exhumed landscape (Figure 1).

Cratons

Vast areas of hot and mid-latitude deserts are underlain by ancient cratons, such as the Yilgarn Craton of arid Western Australia and the Precambrian Shield or Basement Complex rocks in the

Sahara. Some of these areas have been stable for over 500 million years, and some for well over twice that time. Long-term erosion has reduced the landscape to a gently undulating plain. Later invasions by the sea (marine transgressions) have left behind a relatively thin layer of horizontal marine sediments, as in northern Egypt.

Geomorphological processes

Mechanical weathering, involving the disintegration of rocks in situ without any chemical change, takes place in hot deserts due to two main factors:

·       the high rates of insolation

·       the action of salt.

Insolation weathering is the rupturing of rocks and minerals primarily as a result of large daily temperature changes which lead to temperature gradients within the rock mass. These are manifested in a number of ways [Figure 2]:

·       Exfoliation (onion skin weathering) is most noticeable on rocks with few joints or bedding planes (e.g. granite, massive sandstone). It occurs because the surface heat does not penetrate very deeply into these rocks. The outer layers expand and contract daily, but the interior does not. This differential leads to weaknesses parallel to the surface. Layers peel off the rock in an onion-like way.

·       Granular disintegration occurs in rocks that are comprised of minerals of different colours. Darker minerals absorb more heat than lighter ones (e.g. black mica expands more than grey quartz) and so the rock breaks up grain by grain to produce sand sized material. The high tensile stresses involved have been said to cause rocks to split with sounds like pistol shots.

·       Those rocks that are microcrystalline are subject to shattering (thermal fracturing) by constant diurnal expansion and contraction due to heating and cooling respectively e.g. basalt.

·       Block separation occurs predominently on well-jointed and bedded limestones, where the rock breaks up into blocks along these weaknesses.

·       Frost shattering can occur in deserts where there is some free water and the night time temperatures fall below zero. The water gets into fractures in the rock, freezes at night and so expands. Continual freezing and thawing will result in fragments breaking off.
