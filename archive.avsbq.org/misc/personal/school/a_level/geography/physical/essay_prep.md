### Outline the impact of temperature variation on weathering processes in hot deserts



### Rainforest

*Spatially*, the Amazon is the largest rainforest *globally*, wherein an area the *size of Wales* is deforested *each year*; being repurposed for anthropogenic activities such as: cattle ranching and logging. A repurcussion of this is the natural water cycle being disturbed. Impermeable surfaces, such as the compression of soils from repeated machinery and livestock, reduce soil porosity, which in turn reduces levels of interception and causes flooding.

### Freeze thaw weathering

Freeze thaw weathering, is when rainwater seeps into cracks and joints within the geological strata, wherein it freezes at sub-tero temperature, which the ice increases by 10% in size, causing the roc to shatter, which is exacerbated by high durnal ranges.

### Climate change

Climate change is a change in *global* or *regional* climate patterns. This has been argued to have accelerated with *80ppm of Co2* be8ng released in the *last 50 years* causing the elvel of Co2 to reace over *400* ppm in the atmosphere.

If mitigation of climate change isn't taken the argued tipping point to which the effects are irreversible is by *20230* this can be seen within the cited region of the maldivers where of 200 of their 1200 islands are inhabitle due to sea level rise, the maldives could be wiped out by 2080.

### Explain role of cryospheric change in the water cycle

The cryosphere refers to the major storage of water in the form of ice approximately 1.7%. The cryosphere affects the water cycle by maintaining sea levels. For example, during interglacial warming periods, melting takes place adding water to hydrospheric stores such as... Which in turn causes an increased input of water into the ocean stroage meaning sea level rise both due to increased volume and thermal expansion.

Because ice decreases albedo effect and thermal expansion, converse of claical periods, latent heat of freezing , and talk about permathroust. 

Cryospheric change has a regulatory role in sea levels, in a period of cooling (glacias period) the cryosphere can grow in sive, as the water cycle is slowed considerably as the ice restricts the return of water to the sea and ocean, vice versa during periods of warming the cryosphere will add water to the cycle, as the water cycle restarts more of the ice melts and returs water to the sea, this increases the sive of the ocean store causing sea levels to rise throughd increased volumes of wmatetr.

### Explain the concept of dynamic equillibrium in relation to the water cycle

- Dynamic equllibrium, lacj of change in a system, inputs and outputs in xalance, if changes over eehback allows for correlation


- Closed system, where no mater leave-\ekits but energy is transyerred\ no water is added to the global budget, closed system of linked processes.

Dynamic equillibrium refers to the tendency towards a natural state of balance within the hydrological cyle, which is closed , no water is added or leazes the global water budget, water is simply recycled around the system.

The dynamic equillibrium, is easily upset by extreme weather events such as stroms or even huban activity e.g modifyinfg the dynamic equillibrium. This in turn causes disruption and inteference to the dynamic equillibrium and is evidenced through flooding, such events and processes cause sudden changes in the state of the system.

Note: the drainage basin element of the hydrological cycle is the open system where the inputs and outputs can change.

Is the carbon cycle closed?

### Answering a six marker

The graph shows that *overall* Africa is *expected* to see an *increase* in rainfall amount for most months.

This is *evidenced* by months such as, *provide examples*, which also indicates biggest increases around 4mm,

However, *contrary to the pattern*, from *MONTH* to *MONTH* the model suggests that rainfall will be lower than the *DATA* average by as much as *DATA* in *MONTH*.

THIS map gives further information about how changes identified may affect rainfall spatially across africa

### A six marker,

Prolonged periods of rainfall prior to a strom appear to have contributed to the impact of antecedent rainfall. This antecedent rainfall leads to full storage in ground water and in the soil. Saturated groundwater prior to this event has exacerbated the impact of the storm. this almost certainly speeds up overland flow
surface runoff during the storm.

Rock type and gradient lead to the hydrograph flashiness.

An increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide can in turn cause higher rates of evapotranspiration.
Through photosynthesis water influences CO2 absorption through atmospheric store to biosphere.
Water can transfer CO2 from atmosphere to lithosphere/hydrosphere through precipitation in the form of acid rain, in the oceans this thien becomes carxbonic acid.

Amazon rainforest trees intercept 75% of rainfall, ald send it backto the atmosphere, they also absorb co2 and store it. For decomosiion to ocean, water is needed by the decomposers. decompositin is essential for the transfer of carbon from previously locked iomass,it to the atmosphere, which in turn allows for nutrient cycling e.g. in the amazon which suports growth of new plants, 50% of tree bark is in co2


### Food for thought

One may challenge the theme of _the interrelatedness of the carbon and water cycle_. Elements of the water cycle are not inter-related to the carbon cycle. At its core basic elements involve the transfer of water through the lithosphere, hydro/cryo + atmosphere, this is entirely driven by energy and gravity -> independent of the carbon cycle.

### 6 marker guidance

- Patterns
    - Graphs can show rising limbs on specific DATES, with an increase in percentage

- Evidence
    - Graphs can show a falling limb to where it reaches relative approximately at TIME

- Anomaly

- Manipulative
    - Data shown it bo at its highest at approximately (TIME), declining to Xmm by TIME, with the average rainfall being approximately

### Sentence examples

Deforestation is the, *definition*. With __ being 55%, expecting to rise by 68% by 2050, this suggests to be an ever increasing issue and will require a range of strategies to combat the issues.

Over 80% of __ come from __ (through combustion of) and has decreased/increased by X% in the last Y years. Suggesting the issue is arising more and more over a temporal scale

In 40 years indicating an exponential change over the temporal scale

### Conclusion example

Overall, the process of XYZ is heavily subjective based on one's X, while Y provides strong benefits to a Q, as it improves a J that was facing. However to a greater extent, it is outweighed by the fact 

### Ecological footprint

E.f, is the area of "biologically productive" land/water, needed to "produce resources" that a population consumes and also absorbs waste produced essentially, meaning a pupulations dependency on the biosphere for biologically productive land, countries like the UK have a ef ecological footprint of 5.4 meanwhile the uad has ef of 13.8 global hectares per capita

There may be an essay on demographic dividends, however although there is a storn gsuggestion the number of child dependencies is decreasing, it must also be noted the elderly are also a fiscal drag, as 50-54 year olds are no dependents but contribute ot a

If a proportion of a countries popuation such as over 65s are heavily reliant on working age for essential services this halts economic growth, this is prevalent in japan as 40% of gdp is spent on services for the elderly, moreover this is a challenge as less sectors such ash ealthcare and business are being funded, talk about less money for r&d and industries.

secondly a higher elderly dependenc ratio puts more pressure on young and aging people to provide services for the elderly such as nurses, they have become heavily reliant on filipino nurses

Explain how a high infant mortality rate can be a driver of population growth,

Explain the concept of negative feedback use the water cycline or carbon cycle,

definition of nf +1 for elaboration. 2x1 for example MUST HAVE LOOP i.e. nullification of initall effect must be exemplified, indicative content, directly refer to system sensible examples include carbon - vegetation facts figures named locations

In 6 markers, dominant modern or older, combine both figures and notes, comparaie statements about length of residence, note the gnereal trend e.g. as one size of store increases so does... support with figure evidence, volumetric temporal and spatial comparative scales of different stores. quantitative supporting evidence includes

Soil mositure recharge following a period of utilisation/deficit if precipitatiois greater than pet, the soil water store will strart to fill again as water enters soil pores.


deforestation less ineterception soil, less able to store water, agricultural pastoral livestrock ground trampled so less infiltration, arable crops plughing increases inflitration, ditches increase runoff, urbanisation impermeable surface increase runoff,

storm events, seasonal changes, antercedent rainfall -> increased surface rnoff ground is saturated,

soil water is recharged because inputs of precipiation exceeds the output of evaporation, water is utilised in warmer weather. stores are depleting when evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation -> deficit of soil water.

Maximum shortage of water in soil is field capacity

type of soil, permeability of soil + bedrock

water abstraction reduces volume of water in surface store,

flashy: short lag time, steep rising, falling limb, higher floodrisk, higher peak discharge,

subdued, long lag time, gradually rising + falling limb, lower flood risk, low peak discharge,

carbon cycle occurs on local iscale in part or sere lithosphere

drainage basin water balance

this is the balance between inputs and outputs of a drainage basin

water balance is expressed as:
balance between inputs and outputs of a drainage basin, water balance

p = q + e (+/- change in storage)

where p = precipitation
q = runoff
e = evapotranspiration

Rivers will always have a regime they follow, in that some months the discharge of the river will be higher than others. The water balance looks at hov the amount of precipitation compares with the water leaving the system as runoff or as evapotranspiration, the balance will change throughout the year and will be affected by the overall climate of the area near to the river.

For example, under usual conditions the precipitation will be matched by runoff and evapotranspiration giving a 'normal' river level. If evapotranspiration becomes greater for a few months in summer while precipitation and runoff remain the same the river will flow between normal level.

water surplus, there is excess water available within the system, this occurs when precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration and the excess is not being used by plants

deficiency, there is a reduction of water available within the system occurs when ev exceeds precipitation

recharge after a period of deficiency precipitation will occur and replace the lost water in the soil this needs to occur before a period of surplus can reoccur

field capacity the maximum amount of water that soir can hold before it becomes saturated

a water surplus can result in wet soils high river levels and additional runoff whereas a deficit leads to dry soil falling river levels and possibly a drier micro climate.

Predicte impacts of climate change, caused by changes in the cabron budget on this region include the following, firstly an increase in temperature of 2-3c by 2050, which is likely to reuslt in increased rates of evapotranspiratin and a more vigourous hydrological cycle. sea temperatures are exptected to warm too, praticularly in the pacific ocean, this will have a knock on effect o the el nino southern oscialation, which is likely to occur more fruequently

Secondly a decrease in precipiatin durin gthe dry season which can last up to four months of the year is expcected. Reduced rainfall and prolonged drought are features of an el nino year and these could therefore be experienced more frequently, it is also possile that there will be more intense rainfall during the wet season.

### Carbon and water cycle

One can argue, the carbon cycle is entirely dependent upon the water cycle, without the cycling of water throughout the lithosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere, there could be no carbon cycle. 

### Assess the relative importance of the roles of water and wind in shaping desert landscapes

One must demonstrate knowledge of water processes, exogenous, endogenous and ephemeral, the episodic role of water the temporal scale sheet flooding spatial scale channel flash flooding.

Wind: erosion, deflation and abrasion, transportation, suspension, saltation, surface creep and deposition     

Some water landscapes are: wadis, bahadas, pediments, playas and inselbergs

Wind landscapes include: deflation hollows, desert reg pavements, ventifacts, yardangs, zeugens and barcadans seif dunes -> exemplify the role of wind in shaping desert landscapes


sources of energy in hot desert environments; solar insolation, winds] runoff, sediment sources, cells and budgets  

these sources may be used to argue in favour of wind or water

geomorphological, weathering, mass movement, erosion, transportation and deposition, make links to the role of water/wind supporting these processes

wind abrasional processes shape and scour the land yardangs and zeugens are likely to appear

for deposition expect sand dune formation

### Desert 6 marker

Examples

Consistent pattern, but average temperatures do appear to ovary more substantuially year son year

both XYZ appear/do not appear to be experiencing a gradual stepped increase in temperature

Peaks and troughs show a mixed picture in terms of...


There are no signs of stabilisation with both showing continued variation and a general upwards trajectory in temperature definite evidence of correlation

The presence if water leads to an increase in shrubs and grasses which leads to an increase in surface roughnesss more friction less windspeed less soil erosion which ultimately means less sand particles moving. there can be less watedr lost through windspeed

ultimately with water less and invasion will be happening as a resuslt of the thivker denser vegetation cover.If wind speed is reduced there will be a less movement of sand dunes.

Air humidity concentration has increased due to traspiration which is likely in turn to suport the creation of a microclimate which will further improve agricultural productivity as well as supporting the  newly developed ecosystem som=e may refer to plagioclimate in this regard.

Also can give firewood and wood by productss grass for cattle

Tree leaf foliage covewrage also reduces evaporatiom in shrubs pplants directly under, thereby reducing temperature

### Explain the concept of subclimate in succesion

Sub climax vegetation has not been able to mature to the natural climate vlimax vegetation for the region

This is because of arresting factors. The arresting factors is a local factor which has prevented the natural progression of the vegetation to climax.

There are many types of arresting factors some may argue that human inteference is an arresting factor, the palgioclimax is in effect the sub-climax community.

For example a managed upland moore is prevented from reaching maturity because of the human activity.

### With reference to a tropical rainforest evaluate the role of governance in environmental management

### 9 marker analyse the role of nutrient cycling within a hydrosphere or lithosphere

A ltihsosphere which is a sere originating in a rock, is a plant sucession that begins life on a newly exposed rock surfaced such as one left bare as a result of glacial retreat/tectonic uplift in the formation of a riaased beach or a volcanic explosion, such as the lava fields of eldgja with overtime saw lava solidify and nevome lithospheres 

pioneer species are the first organisms that colonise an area of lithosphere  typicallr are very hardy such as xerophytes

in the case of a lithosphere the pioneer species create their own food/water as they ared autotrophic they do not require amnny external nutrition except sunlight

### Episodic role of watedr

The formation of wadis (dry river bed) bahadas (alluvial deposits), playas (dry lake beds), pediments (water eroded plains) inselbergs

The role of water in deserts also extends to a mechanical weathering  process diurnal temperature diurnal temperature is  more powerful when there is an presence of water that support the presenvce of exfolaiation

The role of water in desert vegetation evaporation outweighs water inputs leading to the formation of salt pans left on the plain

These salt lakes are highly saline with high concentration of soluble sodium salts onlt highly specialised halophyte vegetation ial exist evaporation of water has a direct bearing upon salt pan landscape, the role of water is also undermined historically

### The interrelatedness of carbon and water

However one could argue that there are many interrelateness in things such as photosynthesis 

co2 + water this relies on the presemve for water and carbon dioxide for processes such as atranspiration

Furthermore when considering decomposition one must understand how it is undertaken by detrivores which cannot operate
