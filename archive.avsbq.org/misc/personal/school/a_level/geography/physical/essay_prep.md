### Rainforest

*Spatially*, the Amazon is the largest rainforest *globally*, wherein an area the *size of Wales* is deforested *each year*; being repurposed for anthropogenic activities such as: cattle ranching and logging. A repurcussion of this is the natural water cycle being disturbed. Impermeable surfaces, such as the compression of soils from repeated machinery and livestock, reduce soil porosity, which in turn reduces levels of interception and causes flooding.

### Freeze thaw weathering

Freeze thaw weathering, is when rainwater seeps into cracks and joints within the geological strata, wherein it freezes at sub-tero temperature, which the ice increases by 10% in size, causing the roc to shatter, which is exacerbated by high durnal ranges.

### Climate change

Climate change is a change in *global* or *regional* climate patterns. This has been argued to have accelerated with *80ppm of Co2* be8ng released in the *last 50 years* causing the elvel of Co2 to reace over *400* ppm in the atmosphere.

If mitigation of climate change isn't taken the argued tipping point to which the effects are irreversible is by *20230* this can be seen within the cited region of the maldivers where of 200 of their 1200 islands are inhabitle due to sea level rise, the maldives could be wiped out by 2080.

### Explain role of cryospheric change in the water cycle

The cryosphere refers to the major storage of water in the form of ice approximately 1.7%. The cryosphere affects the water cycle by maintaining sea levels. For example, during interglacial warming periods, melting takes place adding water to hydrospheric stores such as... Which in turn causes an increased input of water into the ocean stroage meaning sea level rise both due to increased volume and thermal expansion.

Because ice decreases albedo effect and thermal expansion, converse of claical periods, latent heat of freezing , and talk about permathroust. 

Cryospheric change has a regulatory role in sea levels, in a period of cooling (glacias period) the cryosphere can grow in sive, as the water cycle is slowed considerably as the ice restricts the return of water to the sea and ocean, vice versa during periods of warming the cryosphere will add water to the cycle, as the water cycle restarts more of the ice melts and returs water to the sea, this increases the sive of the ocean store causing sea levels to rise throughd increased volumes of wmatetr.
