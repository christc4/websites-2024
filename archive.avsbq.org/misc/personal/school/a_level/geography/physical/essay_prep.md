### Rainforest

*Spatially*, the Amazon is the largest rainforest *globally*, wherein an area the *size of Wales* is deforested *each year*; being repurposed for anthropogenic activities such as: cattle ranching and logging. A repurcussion of this is the natural water cycle being disturbed. Impermeable surfaces, such as the compression of soils from repeated machinery and livestock, reduce soil porosity, which in turn reduces levels of interception and causes flooding.

### Freeze thaw weathering

Freeze thaw weathering, is when rainwater seeps into cracks and joints within the geological strata, wherein it freezes at sub-tero temperature, which the ice increases by 10% in size, causing the roc to shatter, which is exacerbated by high durnal ranges.

### Climate change

Climate change is a change in *global* or *regional* climate patterns. This has been argued to have accelerated with *80ppm of Co2* be8ng released in the *last 50 years* causing the elvel of Co2 to reace over *400* ppm in the atmosphere.

If mitigation of climate change isn't taken the argued tipping point to which the effects are irreversible is by *20230* this can be seen within the cited region of the maldivers where of 200 of their 1200 islands are inhabitle due to sea level rise, the maldives could be wiped out by 2080.
