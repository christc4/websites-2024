### Global warming


When carbon dioxide releases into the atmosphere from the ocean, it creates what is called a positive atmospheric flux. A negative flux refers to the ocean absorbing carbon dioxide. Think of these fluxes as an inhale and an exhale, where the net effect of these opposing directions determines the overall effect.

Carbon capture is inacessible to LICS, development cannot be decoupled from environmental degredation.

Rain reduces the microbial activity, this is rainsplash impact, rainwater in surface depressions is harmful
*Spatially*, the Amazon is the largest rainforest *globally*, wherein an area the *size of Wales* is deforested *each year*; being repurposed for anthropogenic activities such as: cattle ranching and logging. A repurcussion of this is the natural water cycle being disturbed. Impermeable surfaces, such as the compression of soils from repeated machinery and livestock, reduce soil porosity, which in turn reduces levels of interception and causes flooding.

### Freeze thaw weathering

Freeze thaw weathering, is when rainwater seeps into cracks and joints within the geological strata, wherein it freezes at sub-tero temperature, which the ice increases by 10% in size, causing the roc to shatter, which is exacerbated by high durnal ranges.

### Climate change

Climate change is a change in *global* or *regional* climate patterns. This has been argued to have accelerated with *80ppm of Co2* be8ng released in the *last 50 years* causing the elvel of Co2 to reace over *400* ppm in the atmosphere.

If mitigation of climate change isn't taken the argued tipping point to which the effects are irreversible is by *20230* this can be seen within the cited region of the maldivers where of 200 of their 1200 islands are inhabitle due to sea level rise, the maldives could be wiped out by 2080.

### Explain role of cryospheric change in the water cycle

The cryosphere refers to the major storage of water in the form of ice approximately 1.7%. The cryosphere affects the water cycle by maintaining sea levels. For example, during interglacial warming periods, melting takes place adding water to hydrospheric stores such as... Which in turn causes an increased input of water into the ocean stroage meaning sea level rise both due to increased volume and thermal expansion.

Because ice decreases albedo effect and thermal expansion, converse of claical periods, latent heat of freezing , and talk about permathroust. 

Cryospheric change has a regulatory role in sea levels, in a period of cooling (glacias period) the cryosphere can grow in sive, as the water cycle is slowed considerably as the ice restricts the return of water to the sea and ocean, vice versa during periods of warming the cryosphere will add water to the cycle, as the water cycle restarts more of the ice melts and returs water to the sea, this increases the sive of the ocean store causing sea levels to rise throughd increased volumes of wmatetr.

### Explain the concept of dynamic equillibrium in relation to the water cycle

- Dynamic equllibrium, lacj of change in a system, inputs and outputs in xalance, if changes over eehback allows for correlation


- Closed system, where no mater leave-\ekits but energy is transyerred\ no water is added to the global budget, closed system of linked processes.

Dynamic equillibrium refers to the tendency towards a natural state of balance within the hydrological cyle, which is closed , no water is added or leazes the global water budget, water is simply recycled around the system.

The dynamic equillibrium, is easily upset by extreme weather events such as stroms or even huban activity e.g modifyinfg the dynamic equillibrium. This in turn causes disruption and inteference to the dynamic equillibrium and is evidenced through flooding, such events and processes cause sudden changes in the state of the system.

Note: the drainage basin element of the hydrological cycle is the open system where the inputs and outputs can change.

Is the carbon cycle closed?

### Answering a six marker

This is *evidenced* by months such as, *provide examples*, which also indicates biggest increases around 4mm,

However, *contrary to the pattern*, from *MONTH* to *MONTH* the model suggests that rainfall will be lower than the *DATA* average by as much as *DATA* in *MONTH*.

THIS map gives further information about how changes identified may affect rainfall spatially across africa

### A six marker,

Prolonged periods of rainfall prior to a strom appear to have contributed to the impact of antecedent rainfall. This antecedent rainfall leads to full storage in ground water and in the soil. Saturated groundwater prior to this event has exacerbated the impact of the storm. this almost certainly speeds up overland flow
surface runoff during the storm.

Rock type and gradient lead to the hydrograph flashiness.

An increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide can in turn cause higher rates of evapotranspiration.
Through photosynthesis water influences CO2 absorption through atmospheric store to biosphere.
Water can transfer CO2 from atmosphere to lithosphere/hydrosphere through precipitation in the form of acid rain, in the oceans this thien becomes carxbonic acid.

Amazon rainforest trees intercept 75% of rainfall, ald send it backto the atmosphere, they also absorb co2 and store it. For decomosiion to ocean, water is needed by the decomposers. decompositin is essential for the transfer of carbon from previously locked iomass,it to the atmosphere, which in turn allows for nutrient cycling e.g. in the amazon which suports growth of new plants, 50% of tree bark is in co2


### Food for thought

One may challenge the theme of _the interrelatedness of the carbon and water cycle_. Elements of the water cycle are not inter-related to the carbon cycle. At its core basic elements involve the transfer of water through the lithosphere, hydro/cryo + atmosphere, this is entirely driven by energy and gravity -> independent of the carbon cycle.

drainage basin water balance

this is the balance between inputs and outputs of a drainage basin

water balance is expressed as:
balance between inputs and outputs of a drainage basin, water balance

p = q + e (+/- change in storage)

where p = precipitation
q = runoff
e = evapotranspiration

Rivers will always have a regime they follow, in that some months the discharge of the river will be higher than others. The water balance looks at hov the amount of precipitation compares with the water leaving the system as runoff or as evapotranspiration, the balance will change throughout the year and will be affected by the overall climate of the area near to the river.

For example, under usual conditions the precipitation will be matched by runoff and evapotranspiration giving a 'normal' river level. If evapotranspiration becomes greater for a few months in summer while precipitation and runoff remain the same the river will flow between normal level.

water surplus, there is excess water available within the system, this occurs when precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration and the excess is not being used by plants

deficiency, there is a reduction of water available within the system occurs when ev exceeds precipitation

recharge after a period of deficiency precipitation will occur and replace the lost water in the soil this needs to occur before a period of surplus can reoccur

field capacity the maximum amount of water that soir can hold before it becomes saturated

a water surplus can result in wet soils high river levels and additional runoff whereas a deficit leads to dry soil falling river levels and possibly a drier micro climate.

Predicte impacts of climate change, caused by changes in the cabron budget on this region include the following, firstly an increase in temperature of 2-3c by 2050, which is likely to reuslt in increased rates of evapotranspiratin and a more vigourous hydrological cycle. sea temperatures are exptected to warm too, praticularly in the pacific ocean, this will have a knock on effect o the el nino southern oscialation, which is likely to occur more fruequently

Secondly a decrease in precipiatin durin gthe dry season which can last up to four months of the year is expcected. Reduced rainfall and prolonged drought are features of an el nino year and these could therefore be experienced more frequently, it is also possile that there will be more intense rainfall during the wet season.

### Carbon and water cycle


##### A basic carbon cycle explanation

Atmospheric carbon is uptaken through photosynthesis by vegetation, above ground carbon stores include stem, branches and foliage. Some carbon is internally transferred from above-ground to below-ground carbon soils. Fallen leaves and branches add carbon to soils, yet carbon is lost back into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition of organic matter, such as soil respiration

Below ground carbon consists of roots, litter, some carban is transferred from below ground carbon for example root mortality to the soils, soil carbon, organic, inorganic


#### Carbon cycle

Historically, the cambrian period was 500 million years ago and there was 7000ppm, yet this has sunk to 180ppm during  the quaternary glaciation, nowadays 800 GtC 280ppm to 4000ppm as seen by the carbon observatory, before exams look at keeling curve

Water is ablo to dissolve carbon dioxide, there is a negative correlation between the temperature of the water and the amount of carbon dioxide that can be dissolved. This leads to vertical deep mixing, a term used to describe the most important movement of carbon dioxide in oceans, It occurs when warm water in oceanic surface currents is carried from the warm tropics to the cold polar regions. Here the water is cooled, making it dense enough to sink below the surface layer, sometimes all the way to the ocean bed. When cold water returns to the surface and 
Carbon dioxide can be removed from atmosphere by dissolving in water forming, humans can anthropogenically do this carbonic acid plus water equals acid rain

Phytoplankton in euphotic zone, convert carbon into organic matter, through photosynthesis, this then releases oxygen as a by-product

It can be argued that plants respiring from an increase in co2, oxygen releases. However it is important to realises  that respiration nullifies this,  plants rely on phosphorus nitrogen and sulphur, an increase in carbon dioxide is meaningless if other sources are exhausted,

##### Vertical deep mixing

Warm water in oceanic surface currents, carries warm tropics water to cold polar regions, water is cooled, making it denser and sinks to the ocean bed, when this returs to the surface is loses carbon dioxide to the atmospheric store, carbon pump takes co2 to the ocean depth
Co2 is found in soils, atmosphere and oceans, methane is found in sedimentary rocks and permafrost.
Carbon escapes from mantles at constructive and destructive plate boundaries as well as hot-spot volcanoes, derived from metamorphism of carbonate rocks subducting with ocean crust.

The twilight zone has 37100 gtc

Carbon dioxide naturally returns without humans, tectonic forces continetal margins released also in hot springs

##### In defense of forest fires, 

Old trees will leave healthy ash, this organic soil layer accumalates carbon

##### Global warming

Urban heat island effect, cities are responsible for 47 percent of 

Carbon dioxide is removed into long-term storage by burial of sedimentary rock layers and carbonate rocks.

At the global level, 19 percent of carbon is locked up in plants, directly in the tissues,

The amazon basin is twenty percent of the worlds carbon.

Peat bogs store more than 250 GtC of carbon worldwide.

One can argue, the carbon cycle is entirely dependent upon the water cycle, without the cycling of water throughout the lithosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere, there could be no carbon cycle. 

### Assess the relative importance of the roles of water and wind in shaping desert landscapes

One must demonstrate knowledge of water processes, exogenous, endogenous and ephemeral, the episodic role of water the temporal scale sheet flooding spatial scale channel flash flooding.

Wind: erosion, deflation and abrasion, transportation, suspension, saltation, surface creep and deposition     

Some water landscapes are: wadis, bahadas, pediments, playas and inselbergs

Wind landscapes include: deflation hollows, desert reg pavements, ventifacts, yardangs, zeugens and barcadans seif dunes -> exemplify the role of wind in shaping desert landscapes


sources of energy in hot desert environments; solar insolation, winds] runoff, sediment sources, cells and budgets  

these sources may be used to argue in favour of wind or water

geomorphological, weathering, mass movement, erosion, transportation and deposition, make links to the role of water/wind supporting these processes

wind abrasional processes shape and scour the land yardangs and zeugens are likely to appear

for deposition expect sand dune formation

### Explain the concept of subclimate in succesion

Sub climax vegetation has not been able to mature to the natural climate vlimax vegetation for the region

This is because of arresting factors. The arresting factors is a local factor which has prevented the natural progression of the vegetation to climax.

There are many types of arresting factors some may argue that human inteference is an arresting factor, the palgioclimax is in effect the sub-climax community.

For example a managed upland moore is prevented from reaching maturity because of the human activity.

### With reference to a tropical rainforest evaluate the role of governance in environmental management

### 9 marker analyse the role of nutrient cycling within a hydrosphere or lithosphere

A ltihsosphere which is a sere originating in a rock, is a plant sucession that begins life on a newly exposed rock surfaced such as one left bare as a result of glacial retreat/tectonic uplift in the formation of a riaased beach or a volcanic explosion, such as the lava fields of eldgja with overtime saw lava solidify and nevome lithospheres 

pioneer species are the first organisms that colonise an area of lithosphere  typicallr are very hardy such as xerophytes

in the case of a lithosphere the pioneer species create their own food/water as they ared autotrophic they do not require amnny external nutrition except sunlight

### Episodic role of watedr

The formation of wadis (dry river bed) bahadas (alluvial deposits), playas (dry lake beds), pediments (water eroded plains) inselbergs

The role of water in deserts also extends to a mechanical weathering  process diurnal temperature diurnal temperature is  more powerful when there is an presence of water that support the presenvce of exfolaiation

The role of water in desert vegetation evaporation outweighs water inputs leading to the formation of salt pans left on the plain

These salt lakes are highly saline with high concentration of soluble sodium salts onlt highly specialised halophyte vegetation ial exist evaporation of water has a direct bearing upon salt pan landscape, the role of water is also undermined historically

### The interrelatedness of carbon and water

However one could argue that there are many interrelateness in things such as photosynthesis 

co2 + water this relies on the presemve for water and carbon dioxide for processes such as atranspiration

Furthermore when considering decomposition one must understand how it is undertaken by detrivores which cannot operate without the presence of water

Moreover, detrivores themselves respire which is a key carbon process which operates in the presence of water stored in soils and groundwater

In addition, carbon can be dissolved directly into large water bodies and carbon can be dissolved in precipitation when dissolved in water carbon dioxide reacts with water molecules, forming carbonic acid, which contributes to ocean acidity

Periglacial areas (cryosphere)  the process of decomposition are being exacerbated by climate change, the melting ice in the active layeris leadinf to rapid decomposition and a release of co2 and methane

Natual fires is a process releasing carbon dioxide and methane



Pryscience for example hrw maturation and release of seeds which is triggered in whole or iin part by fire or smoke fgire is a critical ingredient in the renewal of ecosystems or biospheres

one may argue from this that forest fires are not all bad, however of course this depends on the scale intensity and time duration

weatherinf is another process which releases carbon back to the atmosphere lithosphere orand hydroosphe,re requires the presence of water via precipitation or under sea water weathering 

A final sophisticated response is that the carbon cycle is entirely dependent upon the water cycle for its existence, without the cycling of water through the lithosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere , there could be no carbon cycle,


### Outline the input of temperature variation in hot deserts

The main inputs in mechanical weathering the very high diurnal temperature variation causes rocks to break up due to the continued expansion/contraction plus or ten percent caused by the regular rhythmic 
heating and cooling

it is the way high temperatures durind the day and the subsequent very low nightfall temperatures which causes the rock pressure

the very high temperatures also cause evaporaion of soil and ground moisture this contributes to a lack of soil formulation and vegetable growth leaving the area further vulnerable or open to meatherinf process very low temperatures freeze thaw weaathering

## Deforestation

In summation, deforestation causes the greatest impact on the Amazon rainforest - in the short term, allowing more rainwater to reach the ground, reducing evapotranspiration, whereas a long-term look sees climate change likely to have the ggreatest impact. It is predicted that rainfall amounts will become less in total and more variable. Climate change could in fact result in the decrease of the forest naturally, throuugh a drier climate so the two main causes are INTERRELATED

### The carbon budget

The carbon budget, is how much more carbon can be added to the atmosphere, that would hold the global average temperature at 2 degrees, above pre industrial levels amounted to approximately 800 billion tonnes of carbon. So far around 570 billion tonnes of extra carbon have been released, with temperatures currently approaching 1.5 celsius above pre industrial levels.


Radiative forcing, is the difference of incoming solar radiation, insolation, absorbed by the Earth and the energy radiated back into space.

Carbon dioxide is the single most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas GHG in the atmosphere, contributing sixty-five percent of the radiative forcing

Rising levels of carbon dioxide and other GHGs in post-industrial are fuellinf fears of climate change through climate change through atmospheric warming, atmospheric carbon dioxide approached one hundred fifty percent of the pre-industrial levels in 2021, mainly due to emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and cement production (caused by the production of clinker, the key constituent of cement)

At current rates of emissions, around ten billion tonnes of  carbon a year, there are about 25 years until what remains of the above carbon budget, above 230 billion tonnes, is released and the global average temperatures increases by 2 degrees celsius. To avoid dangerous climate change, substantial and sustained reductions in carbon dioxide emissions are needed.

One way of doing this is to leave most of the remaining fossil-fuel reserves in the ground and generate our energy in sustainable ways. Another is to remove some of the 'extra' carbon from the atmosphere. This could be done by managing forests and other land sinks to increase the amount of carbon they take up. There are also technoloogical solutions known as negative emissions technologies.

One example of this is bioenergy capture and storage (BECCS) if the carbon released by burning fossil fuels is captured before it is released back to the atmosphere, then electricity has been generated without increasing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, then electricity has been generated without increasing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere or using up any of the carbon budget. However, BECCS is still at an early stage of development. Moreover, the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere cannot be quickly removed, what ever technologies we deploy.


This means a certain amount of global warming is already 'locked in' the future will, inevitably, be hotter for the planet.

### Hydrographs

A storm hydrograph is a graph which shows theh response oof a river after a particular rainfall event

River discharge is the volume of water passing through a given point in a given point (cross sectional areas x velocity) cumecs

Labels include: discharge (Q) cumecs, time, peak discharge, peak rainfall, laag time, flashy, attentuated, rainfall event, rising limb, falling (descending+ limb, baseflow, bankfull discharge, flood

Basin size, is a permanent control on the storm hydrograph. Rivers with small basins are likely to have a flashier response to a rainfall event than rivers with a large basin whereas the hydrograaph for a large basin will be attentuated. This is because mater has less distance to travel to get to the gauging station in a small basin whereas in a large basin water may have to travel hundreds of miles before reaching the main channel.

Basin shape, rounder basins tributaries are the same distance, less distance to travel however this is reversed in elongated basins

Weather, antecedent rainfall, 

Land usage, urban areas encourage water transfer, more impermeable tarmac increase surface runoff

Management, dams may hold back and store water, afforestation

Rock type, permeability how easily will  water flow through, porosity how many pore spaces. Porous rocks, e.g chalk hold water and slow... granite is more flashy, if soil is attenuated

Soil type, saturated soils result in rapid runoff,

Vegetation type, Decidious trees have few leaves so less 

Drainage density, o lew drainage density leads to slower transfer

ANtecedent soil moisture conditions, if soil das reached its field capacity runoff will be greater

### Salt marshes

We don't know for certain why many areas of marsh vegetation suffer periodic die-back.

#### The formation of salt marshes

Salt marshes, occupy a mid level between the mudflats that edge the permanently submerged marine zone and the terrestrial (land based) haabitats that lie above the high water mark. Like sand dunes they result from the interaction of geoomorphological and ecological processes. The key to their formation is a low energy tidal environment, that is one where the sea's erosional ability is limited. This allows plant colinsation and sediment accumulation. THe plant community  then undergoes a series of changes known as succession. These combine to create a feature thaht can eventually emerge above sea level and become permanent.

#### Factors affecting salt marsh development

Salt marsh, 

- Weather, stoorms can erode the marsh
- River regime, changes in currents and volumes can affect erosion
- Sediment supply, supply changes can enhance or diminish the available stilt
- Human action, commercial industrial and recreational activity can damage marsh
- Sea level, rises can upset equilibrium and destroy the marshes
- Climate, affects species types, growth rates and sea levels
- Wave type, changes in direction, nature and size can affect marsh stability
- Tidal regime, changes in tidal currents can increase erosion and alter species

During their lifetime, salt marshes have to adapt to changes in these factors, they try to maintain a balance between them, so they are said to be in a state of dynamic equillibrium.

The initial low energy environment can result from many causes. The most common causes are:
- the protection from the open sea provided in the inner reaches of estuaries and rias
- the protection offered by spits, bars or other coastal landforms


The latter is common. Indeed the formation of spits and salt marshes is often linked, as can be seen in places such as Hurst Castle Spit in the Western Solent. Once a low energy environment is established a number of processes take place to form a halosere or saltmarsh succession. 

A succession is a vegetation sequence developed over time.

######## The formation of a saltmarsh succession

- As the tidal currents are slowed they begin to deposit material. This is fine grained at first. It may be encouraged by the growth off eelgrass in submerged areas.

- Eel grass helps slow the currents further

- Gradually uneven mud flats develop that are exposed at low tide

- These mud flats can then become colonised by pioneer plant species

- These plants are tolerant of salt and the periodic soaking of the sea caused by low tides. They are known as halophytes, they include species such as glasswort and sea blite. They are small and are annuals, new ones developing from seed each year.

- They gradually develop close vegetation over the mud. This allows colonisation by further types of plants such as sea aster marsh grass and sea lavender. These form a dense mat of vegetation up to fifteen centimetres high.

This vegetation creates friction to slow the tidal currents even further,  which causes more sediment to be deposited. 

- Additionally, the vegetation itself traps particles. These accumulate eventually on the mud

	 The plants also produce leaves and stalks that die and help build the sediment level, This vegetation  waste or detritus can be up to 15 tonnes of dry matter per year

- These processes combine to increase the level ofthe mud flats by between one mm and thirty mm per year. They also provide a food supply for other species, such as small invertebrates to exploit.


As the mud levels rise, complex creek ssystems evolve that channel the flowing and ebbing tides. Thes become deeper as the land rises.

Eventually, the land rises above sea level as new species such as rushes and reeds become established . These species are perennials as are the trees s uch as alder and ash that appear.

By this time the salt marsh succession is completee This halosphere or succession also shows species zonation. Zonation can be defined as distinct spatial distribution. By this stage the upper levels of marsh are rarelly covered by the sea. Only hiigh spring tieds and storms allow them to become inundated.

Students frequently confuse zonation with succession in both salt marshes and sand dunes.

Salt marshes thus become attractive to farming and are often reclaimed. Many of the marshes around southern and eastern  England have been reclaimed and are being defended by sea walls. Today they are relict feawtures and are no longer beinf actively formed. Traditionally, they have been used for cattle oro sheep to graze but some have been draivned and "uimproved" and support arable crops.

Because of rising sea levels, some reclaimed  salt marshes are under theat and as the land is comparitively low value they have now been declared as areas for managed natural retreat. These coastal management strategies wil allow the marine erosion to breach sea defences to recreate the salt marshes as actinf as a natural buffer against future erosion.

ALthough the succession described has taken pylace over hundreds of years in the nineteenth century a new element appeared particularly in southern England. Cordgrass or spartina maritttime existed in england prior to eighteen hundred but increasing trade led to the accidental importation of similar species from abroade These interbred with the native forms to create a new variety called spartina anglica. This is an astonishing plant, perfectly adapted to survive in thte hostile conditions of tidal environments. It has
- glands to secrete salt and minimise dehydration
- deeply recessed pores to reduce water loss
- two root systews - a fine mat of surface roots to bind the mud and long, thick and deep roots with airways that can secure it in up to two metres of sloppy mud

It thus a remarkable ability to thrive  on mudflats. It grows so quickly that it can trap ut to four thoussand tonnes of silt/hectare/year. Not surprisingly a ready export market has been found for it. It has been used for reclamation purposes as a catalyst in countries as far apart as China and France.

Since the nineteen fifties spartina has been in decline possibly due to soil pollition. Salt marshes shave high levels og primarry productivity 

threats to the salt marshes indusstrial polliton, euthrophciation, dredging remove sediment that maap allow scour and erosion grazing 


### Feedback

Where the effects of an action are nullified by subsequent knock-on effects, such as an increase in the level of co2 concentration in the atmosphere may result in increased plant/fauna growth and therefore an increased uptake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis decreasinf co2 in the atmosphere

#### Cascading systems

Made up of a chain of open systems where the output of one system forms the input to another


#### Water balance

The water balance is the difference between the inputs precipitation and outputs channel runoff discharge plus evapotranspiration

#### The drainage basin system

The balance of water ini the drainage basin can be seen in its water budget, the water budget is calculated through the formula 
P = R + ET + ΔS

P - prrecipitation
e - evapotranspiration
delta - change in storage in soil or bedrock

The interaction between run-off, evapotranspiration and storage is in constant changthroughout the years and  depends on both the characteristics  of the pphysical ennvvironnment and climate

During the  dry season there is a soil moisture deficit caused by evapotranspiiration exceeding precipitation, when precipitation exceeds potential evapotranspiration there is soil moisture recharge, which can lead to soil moisture surplus, at this point the field capacity (the maximum amount of maisture that soil can retain) is reached. This will lead to changes in storage and increased throughflow and ground water flow, 


### River Tweed (The Eddleston Water Project)

Historically, the early nineteenth century saw the river's course extensively altered and long sections were straightened. 

The EMP, carried out the following on 17 seperate farms:

- 66 hectares of riparian woodland created which will help increase rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, soil infiltration and also slow overland flow

- 16,000 metres of fencing and over 70,000 native trees planted

- 1.8km of river re-meandered, this has increased river length, reducing the slope and speed of water flow and provided more space for flood waters, as well as creating new habitats and improving the landscape

- 89 'high flow restrictors' installed that will encourage out of bank flow  and hold back water in the headwaters

- 19 leaky ponds were created, 7000 square metres, these wetland features have a good deal of 'free board' built in so that they will store water during intense rainfall events

Runoff from agriculture is being closely monitoreed, farmers are not permitted to allow fertiliser runoff, salmon fishing contributes 24 million to the local economy, 


80% of the catchment is used for agriculture, hill sheep,  cattle

However, soil compaction porosity,

After WW2 forestry comission began planting large scale conifer plantation,

10% of properties at flooding risk, wetlands protected to provide greater storage within DB system, upland trees are planted to increase rates of interception, dredging of larger channels saw the removal of sediment, which in turn increased the channel capacity allowing water to be quickly moved out of the system, Soft engineering in the form of boulders and woody debris left in the upper catchment slow water in upper streams away from human habitation.

Additionally, remeandering of straightened channels, floodbank removal slowed the flow of surface wate by harnessing natural capacity of the landscape to retain water, reducing flood peaks making flood events more manageable


Three main causes of rainfall in UK basins are frontal rain (pressure systems) e.g. atlantic depressions, orographic relief, convectional rain e.g. summer thunderstorms

Flow restrictors encourage out-of-bank flow, thus 'slowing the flow' typically of 'engineered log jams' or 'large woody debris', these instream structures are typically formed from locally derived timber and are deployed in a number of different ways, in the eddlseston catchment there are 40 flow restrictors in place.

Remember:

- Vegetation provides interception store (leaves/branches)
- Water intercepted is evaporated back into the atmosphere
- Water from leaves to ground falls by throughfall
- Water from stems/trunks is stemflow
- Water soaks into soils by infiltration, this movement of water is controlled by gravity, capillary action and soil porosity which is controlled by texture structure and organic content. Coarser soils have larger pores and fissures that allow for larger water flow. Burrowing of worms and insects with the penetration of plant roots can increase soil channels,
- As soil moistens, clay particles absorb water causing them to expand, reducing the size of soil pores, then raindrop impact breaks large soil clumps into smaller partictles such that said particles begin to clog soil surface pores, reducing movement of water into the soil.
- If rainfall intensity is greater than infiltration rate, soil reaches infiltration capacity very quickly, meaning the soil is saturated, water will build on surfaces as surface storage, such as puddles, wher surface stores are full then overland flow and sheet flow will begin on slopes. 
- They will fastly rapidly reach next channels,

- Lateral movement of soil water downslope is called throughflow, more vegetated an areaa is the faster the throughflow is aided by root channels in the soil
- Percolation, infiltration water moves vertically down soil and unsaturated rock, which is then held as groundwater,

Initially rivers are fed by throughflow of soil water and groundwater, slow movement means discharges are small

As storm water enters drainage basin, rivers are fed by fast moving water

The more circulare a drainage basin is, the flashier it is, due to it being equidistant

- Steeper sides, influence of gravity is stronger
- If there is high drainage density, the hydrograph will be flashier

- If there was antecedent rainfall, overland flow increases , the infiltration capacity is reached and lag time is reduced

- If surfaces are baked from dry weather, the impermeableness increases flashiness as...

- Vegetation cover, deforestation reduces interception rates, erodes soil, leads to sedimentation depositon and suspension of channel, reduces bankfall capacity of river, greater chance of flooding

- Ploughing breaks up topsoil

- Before deforestation overland flow is minimal

- Groundwater is stored in aquifers which are layers of permeable rock or soil that can hold water, the water table is the level at which the soil and rocks in an area are saturated with water. When groundwater is abstracted or pumped out of the ground it lowers the water table, this can have several negative effects on the hydrology of the area, one effect from over abstraction is that it can lead to a reduction in the amount of water available for surface water sources such as rivers  and streams. This can make the flow of these waterways more variable, with periodss of low flow during dry s pells and higher flow during wet spells, In turn, this can increase the risk of floodingn during periods of heavy rainfall, as the capacity of the rivers and streams to hold and convey water is reduced.

Another effect of over-abstraction is that it can lead to subsidence or sinking of the ground surface. When water is pumped out of the ground, soils and rock can collapse  in on themselves as they dry out, leading to subsidence. This can create low areas in the landscape, which can be more prone to flooding during periods of heavy rainfall.

Overall, over-abstraction can have a significant impact on the water table, which in turn can increase the risk of flooding in a drainage basin.



If water abstraction in ever coming up remember the aral ea in uzbekistan

Soil moisture is that which is held together with  air in unsaturated upper weathered layers on the earth

Soil moisture is a key  variable in controlling the exchange of water and heat energy between land surface and atmosphere


### Water balance

Biological water will constitute  the water stored in all the biomass storage of water providinng a rrfsorvvoir of water that helps maintain climatiic environmments if vegetation is lost then climates become desert like, in some cases 95 percent of plant weight   

condensation is the direct cause of all forms of precipitation

If air temperature is reduced to dew point warm moist air passes over cold  surfaces volume of air increases but there is no addition of heat (adiabatic cooling) air rises and expands in the lower

Pressure in the upper atmosphere, air is forced to rise over hills (orgraphic rainfall) masses of air of different temperatures and densities meet, (less dense warm air rises over denser cold air) (frontal effect), localized warm surface heat air above, which expands becoming less dense and rises (convectional effect)
