<h1>The Web Sucks</h1>

<p>It has enabled the global information exchange, mass surveillance, studies in
social control, allowed revolutions, made a fortune for many billionaires and
in the meanwhile ruined our climate: the web.</p>

<p>For short: There is an industry which is specialized on extending the resource
usage to display just some characters on your display. Millions of jobs are
based on outputting HTML in an inefficient way. Look at PHP and all the
techniques to extend its &quot;scalability&quot;. It is not scalable, it's a prototyping
language. Not to mention all its syntactic irregularities. Nowadays classes on
classes on classes with getter and setter functions define buttons which can be
stripped down to just a simple character string. The web is the practical
example why corporate software development does not work and never will. It
only ruins our environment, sanity and many brains which could be used for the
better of humanity.</p>
<p>PHP was used as the primary example for how interpreted languages produce
resource waste. There were optimisations for compiling PHP to C++(!). But this
is just a way to allow the mass of programmer sheep to go on and sleep calm at
night.</p>
