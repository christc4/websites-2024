# Farming and the Water Cycle

Agricultural production can take the form of arable farming or pastoral farming.
Agriculture impact both the quantity and quality of water in reivers, which in turn affects the value of rivers for water resources; also impacting aquatic ecology.

## Irrigation

In arid zones, soils require irrigation to sustain crops being grown; water from nearby sources (rivers/bedrock (groundwater) is often used. Most of this water will be used in plant transpiration while some evaporates directly from soil. This is lost to the atmosphere as water vapour, meaning less water remains in rivers as they flow downstream.

Repeated groundwater extraction reduces the amount of water held in this store. Areas where rainfall is strong seasonally, may have groundwater extracted for irrigation which recharges during the wet season. Yet in climatially oposite regions that are dry most of the year, these stores take much longer to recover and are quicker to deplete - as they are not being replinished as quickly. This poses the risk that there may come a point where it is no longer possible to extract groundwater, so irrigation is no longer viable and farmland may have to be abandoned.

## Salination

Repeated irrigation also carries implications for water quality. Most streams contain dissolved salts and other ions, which originate from the weathering of rocks in the catchment. When this salt-containing water is used to irrigate soils, water gets lost through evapotranspiration but salts are left behind. If there are repeated cycles of irrigation, salts build up in soils over time. This is salination.

Perhaps due to antecedent conditions or soil becoming too wet, not all water can be stored by soil if their porosity is full. Excess water, e.g. through rainfall may wash some of these salts ouf of soils and back into rivers, further increasing their salinity as they flow downstream. A combination of reducing the amount of water in rivers and increasing the number of salts entering the river, can lead to much higher concentrations of salts in the river downstream of an agricultural area.

## Soil saturation

Some farmers leave fields fallow between harvests, allowing nutrients in soils to replinish before crops are sown again. Soils can be left bare, or they might have minimal vegetation in the form of stubble. Fields with sparse vegetation cover can be found on pastoral farms, if they have been overgrazed, the lack of vegetation cover means less water will be intercepted, meaning a greater proportion of water reaches the soil.

Transpiration is also reduced, the combination of reduced interception and reduced transpiration means that when fields lie fallow more water reaches and stays in the soil. These soils become closer to saturation, all the pore spaces are full of water. During heavy rainfall events, water is less able to enter the sail and instead it moves over the ground as saturation excess overland flow.

# Compaction and crusting

The lack of interception on fallow land means raindrops are not slowed down by hitting obstacles like leaves and branches, so they hit the ground rapidly. Heavy raindrop impact can redistribute soil particles to form an impermeable 'crust' on the soil surface.

The use of heavy farm vehicles and machinery can have similar effects. 
As machines pass over soil, their weight compacts it, forcing individual soil particles closer together, reducing the volume of pore spaces that water can enter. High grazing densities can have a similar effect, with soil compacted by cattle trampling the land. Crusting and compaction reduce the infiltration rate, so that during heavy storms not all teh rainfall can enter the soil but floms over the land tomards rivers as infiltration excess overland flows.

# Flow channelisation

Fallow agricultural land is also susceptible to soil loss through erosion.
Soil particles are detached by heavy rainfall or erosive overland flows. These soil particles can then be washed over the surface, or in some cases, blown by the wind. Soil erosion leads to the development of rills or gullies, which channel water across fields.

Ploughing also can create small channels in the soil, furrows. In areas, where soils are very wet, some farmers create surface or sub surface drainage channels to rapidly remove the water from the soil. These drainage channels usually discharge directly into the nearby rivers.

# Flooding

The practices described above lead to decreases in infiltration and increases in overland flow and channelised flow, especially at times of high rainfall. These changes hvae implications for flood risk. Overland flow travels faster than throughflow, as there are fewer barriers to slow it down. This is particularly the case over bare soil. The lack of vegetation decreases surface roughnes, so there are fewer obstaces for the water to flow around, thus it moves faster. Water in channels such as rills, gullies, furrows and ditches travel faster, reaching rivers very rapidly. This means that large quantities of water can be delivered to rivers in a short space of time, decreasing lag time and increasing peak discharge, thus making flooding more likely.

# Water quality

Soil particles removed by erosion get washed into rivers where they're either held as suspended sediement or fall to the riverbed. Increased levels of fine sediment in streams can be harmful to aquatic plants, as it makes water cloudier (turbid), blocking out the sunlight they need to photosynthesise. Addtionally, harmful to fish and other aquatic fauna, as fine sediment can disrupt some stages of their life cycles.

# Fertilisers and pesticides

Farmers use fertilisers and pesticides to boost crop growth, or to improve grassland for grazing. Fertilisers are high in nutrients, including nitrogen and potassium. Manure or slurry, which also have high nutrient contents, are also used as fertilisers. If fertiisers are applied in large quantities, or if it rains shortly after application they get washed from field sinto rivers. Once said nutrients enter waterways they can stimulate the growth of algae and other aquatic plants.
This growth can beocme excessive triggering eutrophication. Some species of algae produce substances toxic to mammals, including humans. When the excess growth of plants dies back, the bacteria which decompose the dead vegetation use a lot of oxygen in the water. This depletes the oxygen available for use by other species, which can be fatal for fish and other aquatic life.

Like fertilisers, pesticides can also get washed into waterways, which are ingested by small organisms, in turn eaten by larger ones. In this way, concentrations of pesticide increase up the food chain. Such high concentrations are both harmful to fish and mammals.
