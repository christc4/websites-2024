Prior, winning of olympic bid, stratford bore the label of - "derelict, industrial rail" 
Newham is now the 2nd most diverse borough, within a short time, the demography has also changed,
documentary titled "last whites of the east end" 
growing concerns of "alienatied, marginalastion"
displaced feeling like "outsiders" rather than "insiders". Must be noted that non-english restaurants have increased to 60% of total newham restuarants, moreover the forclosure of traditional anglican churches,pubs with an increase in masjids, temples  have incresaed.. , which can strike a chord with residents ressistant to cultural change

yet, in dedham vale, the effect is not observed on a similar scale. while the painting of john constable attracts over 23,000 tourists each year, "think global act local" restuarants rather depict prefernces more towards a tratidional english palate.

In conclusion, could just as easily change as the albert docks did change
