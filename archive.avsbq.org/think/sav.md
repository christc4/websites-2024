 Hi Christ,

Hope Paper 3 went well today.

A few rules of thumb:

- People who make normative economic statements sit at opposite ends of the knowledge scale. They either don't know what they are talking about or are a leading expert.

- People who talk about capitalism when they really mean the free-market, again, usually don't know what they are talking about.

- Both physics and economics impact our daily lives, yet it is quite rare to find someone who is willing to stand up and make a physics claim despite not having a background/education in it. The same cannot be said of economics&hellip;

- When I think &ldquo;economist&rdquo;, I think academic expert. When you see &ldquo;economist&rdquo; in the news, it usually means some random banker&hellip;

Of course we should always be open to alternative viewpoints and criticism. I just don't think it is sensible to go from &ldquo;monopsony capitalists exploit workers&rdquo;, to &ldquo;abolishing property rights&rdquo;. Especially when markets can be regulated/cooperatives are welcome to exist.
