# Words

## Philosophy

I like multipurpose words, for example the animal Lion, Lionise; Lionel, the particular word for wood, lumber be lumbered wiith something
if words are derived from nouns, they should be commonly known not niche terms like spur
insurmontable
This dovetails this hasa been taxing on us all 
toothless your movement is toothless
